//! Main Herder implementation.
//!
//! The Herder is the central coordinator that drives consensus and manages
//! the transition between ledgers. It integrates with:
//!
//! - **SCP**: For Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
//! - **Overlay**: For network communication (receiving transactions and SCP envelopes)
//! - **Ledger**: For state management and validation
//! - **Transaction processing**: Managing the pending transaction queue
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The Herder owns several key components:
//!
//! - [`TransactionQueue`]: Pending transactions waiting for consensus
//! - [`PendingEnvelopes`]: SCP envelopes for future slots
//! - [`ScpDriver`]: Callbacks for SCP consensus
//! - [`SCP`]: The consensus protocol instance (validators only)
//!
//! # Operating Modes
//!
//! The Herder operates in two modes:
//!
//! - **Observer mode**: Tracks consensus by observing EXTERNALIZE messages from
//!   validators in the quorum. Does not vote or propose values.
//! - **Validator mode**: Actively participates in consensus by proposing transaction
//!   sets and voting. Requires a secret key and quorum set configuration.
//!
//! # Security: EXTERNALIZE Validation
//!
//! EXTERNALIZE messages can fast-forward a node's tracking slot, which is necessary
//! for catching up to the network. To prevent attacks, two security checks are applied:
//!
//! 1. **Quorum membership**: Sender must be in our transitive quorum set
//! 2. **Slot distance limit**: Slot must be within [`MAX_EXTERNALIZE_SLOT_DISTANCE`] of current

// - fallback to current slot when previous is absent
// - both slots absent → None
// - Delayed→agree folding
// - tracking_slot==0 → None
// - tracking_slot==1 edge case
// - non-zero fail_at
//
// Envelope injection uses `herder.scp().receive_envelope()` which
// bypasses herder-level validation (signature verification, quorum
// tracker, close-time checks). This is intentional — these tests
// exercise quorum_health() logic, not envelope ingestion.
