//! Pending SCP envelope management.
//!
//! This module handles buffering and releasing SCP envelopes that arrive
//! for slots that are not yet active. Once a slot becomes active (the node
//! has caught up to that point), the pending envelopes are released for
//! processing.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! When a node is catching up or when SCP messages arrive for future ledger slots,
//! those envelopes cannot be processed immediately. The [`PendingEnvelopes`] manager
//! buffers these envelopes and releases them when the appropriate slot becomes active.
//!
//! # Key Features
//!
//! - **Deduplication**: Tracks envelope hashes to prevent duplicate processing
//! - **Slot Limits**: Limits the number of distinct slots buffered (matching
//!   `LEDGER_VALIDITY_BRACKET`)
//! - **Expiration**: Automatically evicts old envelopes based on configurable age limits
//!
//! # Parity with stellar-core
//!
//! stellar-core's `PendingEnvelopes` does NOT impose per-slot envelope count
//! limits. Cleanup is done by `stopAllOutsideRange(min, max, slotToKeep)`,
//! which removes entire slots outside the active window.
//!
//! Henyey adds a defense-in-depth safety cap ([`MAX_ENVELOPES_PER_SLOT`] =
//! 5000) that bounds per-slot growth. This cap is set well above the
//! theoretical honest maximum (~1500 from 50 quorum nodes × 30 messages) and
//! should never trigger during normal SCP consensus. It exists to prevent
//! memory exhaustion if a quorum member's key is compromised or a quorum-less
//! watcher is flooded. See the constant's doc comment for full derivation.

/// margin. Cannot be reached without a compromised quorum member key or a

///
/// This is NOT the same as the cap removed in #1899. That cap was 100 —

/// Parity reference — stellar-core has two independent sizing concerns:
/// - `MAX_SLOTS_TO_REMEMBER` (12) for already-externalized-slot retention
///   (`stellar-core/src/herder/Herder.h`), controlled by
///   `HerderConfig::max_externalized_slots` in henyey.
/// - `LEDGER_VALIDITY_BRACKET` (100) for envelope-acceptance horizon
///   (`stellar-core/src/herder/Herder.cpp:19`), enforced at the pre-filter
///   layer in henyey (`herder.rs::pre_filter_scp_envelope`).
///
/// Stellar-core's `PendingEnvelopes` does NOT impose a separate
/// per-slot-distance horizon inside the buffer — envelope acceptance is
/// gated ONCE at the pre-filter. Henyey previously had an additional narrow
/// gate (`max_slot_distance = 12`) here that caused issue #1807: in
/// accelerated mode (1 s/ledger) the primary could run > 12 slots ahead of
/// the captive-core observer post-catchup, and otherwise-valid EXTERNALIZE
/// envelopes were silently dropped as `SlotTooFar`. The field has been
/// removed to match stellar-core.
///
/// stellar-core also does NOT impose per-slot envelope count limits.
/// The `max_per_slot` field that previously existed here was
/// henyey-specific and caused issue #1899: during heavy-TX bursts the
/// per-slot cap filled up and critical CONFIRM/EXTERNALIZE votes were
/// dropped, stalling the node. It has been removed to match stellar-core.
///
/// However, henyey now adds a high safety cap ([`MAX_ENVELOPES_PER_SLOT`])
/// as defense-in-depth against memory exhaustion from compromised validators
/// or flood attacks on quorum-less watchers. This cap is 50× above the old
/// one and cannot be reached during honest SCP consensus.
