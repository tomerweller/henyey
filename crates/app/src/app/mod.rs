//! Core application struct and component initialization for rs-stellar-core.
//!
//! This module contains the [`App`] struct, which is the central coordinator for all
//! Stellar Core subsystems. It manages the lifecycle of:
//!
//! - **Database**: SQLite persistence for ledger headers, transactions, and state
//! - **BucketManager**: Merkle tree storage for ledger entry snapshots
//! - **LedgerManager**: Ledger close operations and state transitions
//! - **OverlayManager**: P2P network connections and message routing
//! - **Herder**: SCP consensus coordination and transaction queue management
//!
//! # Application Lifecycle
//!
//! The typical lifecycle of an App instance:
//!
//! 1. **Initialization** ([`App::new`]): Load configuration, open database, initialize
//!    subsystems, and restore state from disk
//! 2. **Catchup** ([`App::catchup`]): If behind, download and apply history from archives
//! 3. **Run** ([`App::run`]): Enter the main event loop, processing peer messages
//!    and participating in consensus
//! 4. **Shutdown** ([`App::shutdown`]): Gracefully stop all subsystems
//!
//! # State Machine
//!
//! The application transitions through these states (see [`AppState`]):
//!
//! ```text
//! Initializing -> CatchingUp -> Synced <-> Validating
//!                     ^            |
//!                     |            v
//!                     +--- ShuttingDown
//! ```
//!
//! # Consensus Integration
//!
//! For validator nodes, the App coordinates SCP message flow:
//! - Receives SCP envelopes from peers via the overlay
//! - Passes them to the Herder for processing
//! - Broadcasts locally-generated envelopes back to peers
//! - Triggers ledger close when consensus is reached
