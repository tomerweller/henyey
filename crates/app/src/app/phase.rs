//! Fine-grained sub-phase constants for event-loop watchdog attribution.
//!
//! See `App::event_loop_phase_sub`. These constants are stamped by
//! [`App::set_phase_sub`](super::App::set_phase_sub) immediately before
//! each notable `.await` on a coarse phase whose callees may block. The
//! WATCHDOG thread (in `App::start_event_loop_watchdog`) prints both
//! `phase` and `phase_sub` in its warn/error lines, so the next freeze
//! heartbeat names the exact `.await`.
//!
//! Issue #1788 context: the coarse `phase=13 buffered_catchup` label
//! covers everything from
//! `process_externalized_slots` (ledger_close.rs) stamping `set_phase(13)`
//! up to `spawn_catchup` setting `phase=14` *inside* its spawned task —
//! a large transitive subtree including `maybe_start_buffered_catchup`,
//! `out_of_sync_recovery`, `trigger_recovery_catchup`, and the
//! synchronous prefix of `spawn_catchup`. The `PHASE_13_*` constants
//! below disambiguate which `.await` is currently parked.
//!
//! Convention: constants are one-based dense integers within a coarse
//! phase. Zero means "coarse phase entered, sub-phase not yet set".
