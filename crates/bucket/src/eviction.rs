//! Eviction scan implementation for Soroban state archival.
//!
//! This module implements the incremental eviction scan that matches
//! stellar-core's behavior. The eviction scan is responsible for
//! identifying expired Soroban entries (contract data, contract code)
//! and processing them for archival or deletion.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! State archival in Soroban uses a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism where entries
//! have a `liveUntilLedger` value. When the current ledger exceeds this value,
//! the entry is considered expired and must be evicted:
//!
//! - **Temporary entries**: Deleted immediately (not archived)
//! - **Persistent entries**: Archived to the Hot Archive bucket list, then deleted
//!   from the live bucket list
//!
//! ## Incremental Scanning
//!
//! Unlike a full scan which would be expensive, eviction is performed incrementally:
//!
//! 1. Each ledger scans a limited number of bytes (default 100KB)
//! 2. Position is tracked with an `EvictionIterator`
//! 3. Scanning continues from where it left off on the next ledger
//! 4. When a bucket receives new data (spill), the iterator resets to the beginning
//!    of that bucket to ensure new entries are scanned
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! - **EvictionIterator**: Tracks current scan position (level, curr/snap bucket, byte offset)
//! - **Scan Size**: Configurable bytes to scan per ledger (default 100KB)
//! - **Starting Level**: Minimum bucket list level to scan (default level 6, since lower
//!   levels update too frequently)
//! - **Spill Detection**: When a bucket receives new data from a level below spilling,
//!   the iterator resets to rescan from the beginning
//!
//! ## Bucket List Level Math
//!
//! The bucket list has a hierarchical structure where lower levels update more frequently:
//!
//! - `level_size(N)` = 4^(N+1): The idealized size boundary for level N
//! - `level_half(N)` = level_size(N) / 2: Half the level size
//! - `level_should_spill(ledger, N)`: Returns true when level N spills at the given ledger
//! - `bucket_update_period(N, is_curr)`: How often a bucket receives new data
//!
//! | Level | level_size | level_half | curr updates every | snap updates every |
//! |-------|------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
//! | 0     | 4          | 2          | 1 ledger           | 2 ledgers          |
//! | 1     | 16         | 8          | 2 ledgers          | 8 ledgers          |
//! | 2     | 64         | 32         | 8 ledgers          | 32 ledgers         |
//! | 3     | 256        | 128        | 32 ledgers         | 128 ledgers        |
//! | ...   | ...        | ...        | ...                | ...                |
//! | 6     | 16384      | 8192       | 2048 ledgers       | 8192 ledgers       |
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use henyey_bucket::{EvictionIterator, update_starting_eviction_iterator};
//!
//! // Initialize iterator at default starting level (6)
//! let mut iter = EvictionIterator::with_default_level();
//!
//! // Before scanning each ledger, check if the iterator needs to reset
//! // (because the bucket received new data)
//! update_starting_eviction_iterator(&mut iter, 6, current_ledger);
//!
//! // Perform the scan (handled by BucketList::scan_for_eviction_incremental)
//! let result = bucket_list.scan_for_eviction_incremental(iter, current_ledger, &settings)?;
//!
//! // Update iterator for next ledger
//! iter = result.end_iterator;
//! ```
