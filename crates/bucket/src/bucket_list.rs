//! BucketList implementation - the full hierarchical bucket structure.
//!
//! The BucketList is Stellar's core data structure for storing ledger state.
//! It consists of 11 levels (0-10), where each level contains two buckets:
//!
//! - `curr`: The current bucket being filled with new entries
//! - `snap`: The snapshot bucket from the previous spill
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The bucket list is a log-structured merge tree (LSM tree) optimized for
//! Stellar's append-heavy workload. Lower levels update more frequently and
//! contain recent data, while higher levels contain older, more stable data.
//!
//! ```text
//! Level 0:  [curr] [snap]   <- Updates every 2 ledgers
//! Level 1:  [curr] [snap]   <- Updates every 8 ledgers
//! Level 2:  [curr] [snap]   <- Updates every 32 ledgers
//! ...
//! Level 10: [curr] [snap]   <- Never spills (top level)
//! ```
//!
//! # Spill Mechanics
//!
//! When a level "spills", its `curr` bucket becomes its new `snap`, and
//! the old `snap` is merged into the next level's `curr`. Spill boundaries
//! follow stellar-core's `levelShouldSpill` rules:
//!
//! - `level_size(N)` = 4^(N+1): Size boundary for level N
//! - `level_half(N)` = level_size(N) / 2: Half-size boundary
//! - A level spills when the ledger is at a half or full size boundary
//!
//! # Hash Computation
//!
//! The bucket list hash is computed by hashing all level hashes together.
//! Each level hash is `SHA256(curr_hash || snap_hash)`. This Merkle tree
//! structure enables efficient integrity verification.
//!
//! # Entry Lookup
//!
//! Lookups search from level 0 to level 10, checking `curr` then `snap`
//! at each level. The first match is returned (newer entries shadow older).
//! Dead entries (tombstones) shadow live entries, returning None.
