# BUCKETLISTDB_SPEC Adherence — henyey-bucket

**Spec version:** 26 (stellar-core v26.0.1 / Protocol 26)
**Crate:** crates/bucket
**Last updated:** 2026-05-13
**Overall adherence:** 86%

**Counts:** Full 56 | Partial 8 | Absent 1 | Drift 2 | N/A 5

> Henyey targets Protocol 24+ exclusively. Pre-P24 constructs (pre-P11 LIVEENTRY
> semantics, P11/P12-only shadow algorithms, V0 bucket metadata extensions) are
> classified as N/A or Partial-with-P24+-waiver. Determinism within the P24+

## Detailed Findings (by section)

### §3.3 Sort Order
`compare_entries` (`entry.rs:174-181`) treats `Metaentry` (no key) as strictly
less than every keyed entry; `compare_keys` (`entry.rs:150-152`) delegates to
`LedgerKey`'s derived `Ord`, which matches stellar-core's xdrpp recursive
field-by-field comparator (rs-stellar-xdr declares enum variants and struct
fields in XDR declaration order). The streaming validator
(`entry.rs:216-266`, INV-B16) enforces:
- at most one metadata entry,
- metadata-before-keys,
- strict-ascending keyed sequence.

### §4.7 BucketList Hash
`BucketList::hash()` at `bucket_list.rs:1629-1637` concatenates
`level.hash()` for each level and SHA-256s the result; per-level
`level.hash()` at `bucket_list.rs:775-784` does
`SHA256(curr.hash() || snap.hash())`. Matches `§4.7` exactly.

The combined `bucketListHash` for protocol ≥23 (`SHA256(live || hot_archive)`)
lives in `crates/history/src/replay/execution.rs:468` (`combined_bucket_list_hash`).
Although primary scope is the `bucket` crate, this is the canonical
implementation of INV-B15 in the workspace.

### §5.3 addBatch
`add_batch_internal` at `bucket_list.rs:2221-2403` processes spills in
descending order from `kNumLevels-1` to 1, calls `commit()` then
`prepare_with_normalization()` on each spilling level, then applies the
new batch to level 0 via `prepare_first_level()`. Shadow gathering at
line 2303-2313 falls through to empty for protocols >= V12 (P24+ never
populates shadows). The spec's "pop last two shadows" step is implicitly
captured because under P24+ the shadow vector is unconditionally empty.

### §5.5 Level 0 In-Memory Merge
`prepare_first_level` (`bucket_list.rs:1203-1265`) selects the in-memory
fast-path when both inputs have in-memory entries, otherwise falls back
to the on-disk merge path. `merge_in_memory` (`merge.rs:589-732`) keeps
the result in memory for the next ledger and persists it to disk on the
next `add_batch_internal` background-persist pass (`bucket_list.rs:2362-2401`).
The metadata version is set to `max_protocol_version` directly
(matches stellar-core `LiveBucket::mergeInMemory` `LiveBucket.cpp:569`).

### §6.4 Equal-Key Merge Rules (Live) — heart of bucket correctness
The full normative matrix from `§6.4` is implemented at `merge.rs:864-926`:

| old → new | INIT = y | LIVE = y | DEAD |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|
| INIT = x | panic!() at line 901-903 | `Initentry(y)` at 884-886 | `None` (annihilation) at 874 |
| LIVE = x | panic!() at line 901-903 | `Liveentry(y)` at 889-891 | `Deadentry(key)` at 906-912 if keep else None |
| DEAD    | `Liveentry(x)` at 878-880 | `Liveentry(y)` at 894-896 | `Deadentry(key)` at 915-921 if keep else None |

Specifically:
- `(INIT, INIT)` and `(LIVE, INIT)` are routed through the wildcard arm at
  line 901-903 and panic with the canonical message
  `"Malformed bucket: old non-DEAD + new INIT."` — matches stellar-core
  `LiveBucket::mergeCasesWithEqualKeys`.
- `(DEAD, INIT=x) → LIVE=x` per the second arm (spec: emit `LIVE = x`).
- `(INIT=x, LIVE=y) → INIT=y` per the third arm.
- `(INIT, DEAD) → None` (annihilation) per the first arm.
- `(LIVE/DEAD, DEAD)` writes a tombstone iff `keep_dead_entries == Keep`,
  matching `§6.6` interaction.

The four "easy" cases (old<new, new<old, both-exhausted, equal) are
implemented at `merge.rs:236-282` via key-compare on the peeked head
of each iterator.

### §6.6 Tombstone Elision at the Deepest Level
`should_keep_entry` at `merge.rs:826-831` drops `Deadentry` when policy
is `Remove`; `BucketList::keep_tombstone_entries` at `bucket_list.rs:2473-2479`
sets `Remove` exclusively when `level == kNumLevels - 1`. Hot Archive
analog at `hot_archive.rs:1865, 1871, 1880, 1886, 1894` honors
`keep_tombstones` independently.

Note: independent of the keep-dead policy, `BucketOutputIterator::put`
at `iterator.rs:451-454` also drops dead entries when its
`keep_tombstones` flag is false, providing a second-layer defense
that mirrors stellar-core's `BucketOutputIterator::maybePut`.

### §7.1 FutureBucket State Machine
The state diagram (Clear, HashOutput, HashInputs, LiveOutput, LiveInputs)
is implemented at `future_bucket.rs:279-308` as a Rust enum
(`FutureBucketInner`) where each variant carries exactly the fields it
needs — making the spec's "invalid" combinations unrepresentable. The
`check_state()` method at line 444-473 is retained for API compatibility
but is now a no-op (deprecated, asserts only hash/bucket consistency
in debug builds).

### §7.3 MergeKey
`MergeKey` at `future_bucket.rs:81-99` is `(keep_tombstones, curr_hash, snap_hash)`.
The spec's `MergeKey` is `(keepTombstoneEntries, currHash, snapHash, shadowHashes)`.
Henyey omits `shadowHashes` because under P24+ shadows are always empty
(shadows were removed at protocol 12). The omission is documented inline
at `future_bucket.rs:72-79`. Correct within henyey's stated scope.

### §10.5 Inflation Winners
`load_inflation_winners` at `snapshot.rs:871-937`:
- per-account `balance >= 1_000_000_000` to contribute votes (line 904) ✓
- accumulated `votes >= min_balance` to qualify as winner (line 926) ✓
- sorted by votes descending, truncated to `max_winners` (lines 931-934) ✓
- youngest-level wins via `seen_accounts` (lines 893-896) ✓
- `Deadentry::Account` marks the account as seen but contributes no votes (line 912-915) ✓

The doc comment at `snapshot.rs:898-902` cites `§10.6` but the matter is
actually specified in `§10.5` ("Inflation Winners (Legacy)"). See
Dangling Anchors below.

### §12.4 In-Bucket Scan / Newest-Version Replacement
`scan_bucket_region` (`eviction.rs:553-660`) unconditionally replaces the
candidate payload with the newest version returned by the bulk-load
(`eviction.rs:626-640`). The spec's `§12.4` makes this behavior
@version(≥24) only — at @version(=23) the "older payload" bug is
required for determinism. Documented inline (`eviction.rs:621-624`).
Under henyey's P24+ scope this is correct; if pre-P24 catchup were
introduced, a version guard would be required. Flagged as **Partial** /
P24+ waiver, not Drift.

### §13.1 Bucket Application — Intentional Model Divergence
`BucketApplicator::advance` (`applicator.rs:297-367`) treats `LIVE` and
`INIT` entries identically (both become `Upsert`) and does **not**
restrict to OFFER-range entries. This is a deliberate divergence
documented at `applicator.rs:319-327`: stellar-core distinguishes
deepest-level `LIVE` (treat as `create` per INV-B12) and restricts
non-BucketListDB apply to the OFFER range. Henyey operates exclusively
in BucketListDB mode where:
1. all entry types are served directly from the BucketList query layer
   (`§10`), and
2. the bucket-applicator's catchup path is an idempotent
   upsert/delete sequence — `seen_keys` ensures youngest-wins semantics
   so the LIVE-vs-INIT distinction at the deepest level is unobservable.

Classified as **Drift (INV-B12)** for transparency; behavior is
functionally equivalent under henyey's invariants. See Drift Items
below.

## Dangling Spec Anchors

- `crates/bucket/src/snapshot.rs:900` cites `BUCKETLISTDB_SPEC §10.6`
  for the 1B-stroop minimum balance rule in `load_inflation_winners`.
  The rule is in **§10.5 Inflation Winners (Legacy)**; §10.6 is
  "Entry Type Scan". Fix: change `§10.6` → `§10.5`.
- `crates/bucket/src/snapshot.rs:1718` (test comment) repeats the same
  off-by-one. Fix: change `§10.6` → `§10.5`.

All other in-crate anchors (§3.4, §6.3, §6.4, §6.6, §7.1, §7.3, §8.2,
§11.4, §12, §12.4, §13.1) resolve to the correct (existing) sections in
the regenerated v26 spec.

---

## Drift Items (require human review)

- **§13.1 / INV-B12 (Last-level INIT correctness).** Henyey's BucketListDB
  applicator (`applicator.rs:297-367`) does **not** promote a deepest-level
  `LIVEENTRY` to `INITENTRY` semantics during catchup apply (the spec
  requires "MUST be treated as INITENTRY (a create)"). Under henyey's
  invariants — all entry types served from the BucketList, idempotent
  upsert/delete, youngest-wins via `seen_keys` — the externally observable
  state is identical, because:
  1. The applicator's `EntryToApply::Upsert` is equivalent to both
     `create` and `update` at the storage layer (no FK or
     create-vs-update predicate).
  2. The youngest occurrence of any key wins via `seen_keys`, so
     deepest-level entries are only applied when no younger occurrence
     exists.
  The divergence is documented at `applicator.rs:319-327`. **Decision
  required**: keep as model divergence (current henyey behavior) vs.
  add an explicit deepest-level branch to track the spec verbatim.
  Recommend keeping as model divergence — the henyey applicator is
  semantically equivalent and avoids cross-crate `LedgerTxn` coupling.

- **§6.1 / INV-B4 (Effective merge protocol — shadow inclusion).**
  Spec: `protocolVersion := max(old.ver, new.ver,
  any shadow.ver < FIRST_PROTOCOL_SHADOWS_REMOVED)`. Henyey:
  `protocolVersion := max(old.ver, new.ver)` — shadow versions are not
  included (`merge.rs:1071-1102`). Under henyey's P24+ scope shadows are
  always empty, so the third operand is always vacuous and the rule
  collapses to henyey's implementation. Textually divergent but
  behaviorally equivalent within scope. Documented at
  `merge.rs:1066-1070`. **Decision required**: accept as P24+ waiver
  (recommended) vs. add the shadow-version max with a `debug_assert!`
  that shadows are empty (cleaner but non-functional).

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the two `§10.6` → `§10.5` anchor typos** in `snapshot.rs`
   (lines 900 and 1718). Trivial, no behavioral impact.
2. **Add an explicit `EvictionResultCandidates::isValid` analogue**
   (§12.5). Today the henyey scan is invoked synchronously by the
   ledger close, so the spec's cross-ledger invalidation hazard does
   not arise — but if eviction ever moves to a true background thread
   pool, this check would be required. Track as a follow-up issue
   only if/when background eviction is reintroduced.
3. **Add a `noteEmptyMergeOutput` analogue** to the
   `BucketMergeMap` (§8.1). Today an empty merge short-circuits at the
   merge-output construction site, so the spec's "future-skipping"
   optimization is implicit. Low impact; consider adding for
   memory-hygiene parity.
4. **Reconcile INV-B12 (deepest-level LIVE = INIT)** by either
   (a) accepting the documented model divergence as a permanent design
   choice and noting it in `PARITY_STATUS.md`, or
   (b) adding an explicit branch in `BucketApplicator::advance` for
   deepest-level LIVE. Recommend (a).
5. **Add a `// Spec:` anchor** on the combined-bucketList-hash code in
   `crates/history/src/replay/execution.rs:468` pointing to
   `BUCKETLISTDB_SPEC §4.7` / `INV-B15`. The implementation is correct
   but discoverability is poor (lives in a different crate from the
   spec primary mapping).
