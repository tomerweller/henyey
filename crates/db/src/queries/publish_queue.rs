//! Publish queue queries.
//!
//! The publish queue tracks checkpoint ledgers that need to be published
//! to history archives. When a checkpoint is reached (every 64 ledgers),
//! the ledger is added to the queue. After successful publication, the
//! ledger is removed from the queue.
//!
//! This allows the node to resume publishing after a restart without
//! missing checkpoints.
