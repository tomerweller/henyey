//! Database error types.
//!
//! This module defines the error types used throughout the database layer.
//! All errors are consolidated into the [`DbError`] enum which provides
//! automatic conversion from underlying error types.

use thiserror::Error;

/// Errors that can occur during database operations.
///
/// This enum consolidates all error types from the database layer, providing
/// a unified error type for callers. Most variants wrap underlying errors
/// from SQLite, the connection pool, or XDR serialization.
///
/// # Error Categories
///
/// - **Infrastructure errors**: [`Sqlite`](DbError::Sqlite), [`Pool`](DbError::Pool),
///   [`Io`](DbError::Io) - failures in the underlying systems
/// - **Data errors**: [`Xdr`](DbError::Xdr), [`Integrity`](DbError::Integrity),
///   [`NotFound`](DbError::NotFound) - problems with data format or existence
/// - **Schema errors**: [`Migration`](DbError::Migration) - schema version incompatibilities
