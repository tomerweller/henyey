//! Ledger management for rs-stellar-core.
//!
//! This crate provides the core ledger state management and ledger close pipeline
//! for the Stellar network. It coordinates transaction execution, state updates,
//! bucket list modifications, and ledger metadata generation.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The crate is organized around several key components:
//!
//! - [`LedgerManager`]: The central coordinator for all ledger operations
//! - [`LedgerCloseData`]: Input data for closing a ledger
//! - [`LedgerDelta`]: Accumulates state changes during ledger processing
//! - [`LedgerSnapshot`]: Point-in-time immutable view of ledger state
//!
//! # Ledger Close Process
//!
//! The ledger close process is handled by [`LedgerManager::close_ledger`]:
//!
//! 1. **Receive externalized data**: SCP consensus provides a [`LedgerCloseData`]
//!    containing the transaction set, close time, and any protocol upgrades.
//!
//! 2. **Close ledger**: [`LedgerManager::close_ledger`] executes all transactions,
//!    updates the bucket list, and commits the new ledger header.
//!
//! # State Model
//!
//! Ledger state consists of typed entries stored in the bucket list:
//!
//! - **Accounts**: XLM balances, sequence numbers, signers, thresholds
//! - **Trustlines**: Non-native asset balances and authorization
//! - **Offers**: Order book entries for the DEX
//! - **Data entries**: Arbitrary key-value data attached to accounts
//! - **Claimable balances**: Pending balance claims with predicates
//! - **Liquidity pools**: AMM pool state (Protocol 18+)
//! - **Contract data**: Soroban smart contract storage (Protocol 20+)
//! - **Contract code**: Soroban WASM bytecode (Protocol 20+)
//!
//! # Fee and Reserve Calculations
//!
//! The [`fees`] and [`reserves`] modules provide utilities for calculating:
//!
//! - Transaction fees based on operation count and base fee
//! - Account minimum balances based on sub-entries and sponsorship
//! - Available balance for spending (accounting for reserves and liabilities)
//!
//! # Example Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use henyey_ledger::{LedgerManager, LedgerManagerConfig, LedgerCloseData, TransactionSetVariant};
//!
//! // Create a ledger manager
//! let manager = LedgerManager::new(network_passphrase, LedgerManagerConfig::default());
//!
//! // Initialize from buckets (during catchup)
//! manager.initialize(bucket_list, hot_archive_bucket_list, header, header_hash)?;
//!
//! // Close a ledger
//! let close_data = LedgerCloseData::new(seq, tx_set, close_time, prev_hash);
//! let result = manager.close_ledger(close_data)?;
//! println!("Closed ledger {}", result.ledger_seq());
//! ```
//!
//! # Protocol Compatibility
//!
//! This crate supports all Stellar protocol versions, with special handling for:
//!
//! - **Protocol 18**: Liquidity pools (AMM)
//! - **Protocol 20**: Soroban smart contracts
//! - **Protocol 23**: Hot archive bucket list for state archival
