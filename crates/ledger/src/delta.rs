//! Change tracking for ledger close operations.
//!
//! This module provides [`LedgerDelta`], which accumulates all state changes
//! during the processing of a single ledger. The delta serves as the
//! transaction log for the ledger close, enabling:
//!
//! - **Bucket list updates**: Changes are applied to the Merkle tree
//! - **Transaction metadata**: Change history for each transaction
//! - **Database updates**: Persistent storage synchronization
//! - **Invariant checking**: Validation of state consistency
//!
//! # Change Semantics
//!
//! The delta tracks three types of changes via [`EntryChange`]:
//!
//! - **Created**: New entries that didn't exist before
//! - **Updated**: Existing entries with modified values
//! - **Deleted**: Entries that have been removed
//!
//! # Change Coalescing
//!
//! When multiple operations affect the same entry within a ledger, changes
//! are coalesced to produce the minimal final diff:
//!
//! - Create + Update = Create (with final value)
//! - Create + Delete = No change (entry never existed in previous state)
//! - Update + Update = Update (original previous, final current)
//! - Update + Delete = Delete (original previous)
