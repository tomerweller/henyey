## Detailed findings (by section)

### §3.1 — HAS data type
- **Claim §3.1-1** (MUST): `version ∈ {1,2}`, `currentBuckets` has exactly `LIVE_BUCKETLIST_LEVELS`, `hotArchiveBuckets` present iff version ≥ 2.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/verify.rs:709-761`
- **Status**: Full. Both directions enforced — v1 must not contain `hotArchiveBuckets`, v2 must contain it. Also enforces `networkPassphrase` required at v≥2.

### §4.2 — Path Construction
- **Claim §4.2-1** (MUST): paths split as `<NN>/<NN>/<NN>/...-<LSEQ>.xdr.gz` where `LSEQ = lowercaseHex8(L)`.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/paths.rs:47-94`
- **Status**: Full. Tests for ledger 63, 127, 100 all match spec.

### §4.3 — Checkpoint Frequency / Math
- **Claims §4.3-1..4** (MUST/SHALL): `CHECKPOINT_FREQUENCY = 64`; `checkpointContainingLedger(L)`, `isLastLedgerInCheckpoint(L)`, `firstLedgerInCheckpointContaining(L)`, `sizeOfCheckpointContaining(L)`, ledger-zero pseudo-checkpoint at `history/00/00/00/history-00000000.json`.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/checkpoint.rs:22-274`, `crates/history/src/paths.rs:149-151`, `crates/history/src/lib.rs:689-760`.
- **Status**: Full. Doctests cover the boundary cases (`checkpoint_start(0..=128)`, `size_of_checkpoint_containing`).
- **Notes**: There's also `ACCELERATED_CHECKPOINT_FREQUENCY = 8` for `ARTIFICIALLY_ACCELERATE_TIME_FOR_TESTING`. Spec §16 calls 64 consensus-fixed; the test override is consistent with stellar-core's `getCheckpointFrequency`.

### §4.4 — HAS Structural Validation
- **Claim §4.4-1..8** (MUST): version range, networkPassphrase at v≥2, bucket level counts, bucket-version non-decreasing as level decreases, level-0 `next` clear, level-i `next` clear iff prev_snap version ≥ FIRST_PROTOCOL_SHADOWS_REMOVED=12 (else has resolved output hash), 100 GB bucket cap.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/verify.rs:709-761` (`verify_has_structure`), `crates/history/src/archive_state.rs:404-473` (`validate_bucket_list_structure`), `crates/history/src/archive_state.rs:23` (`MAX_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_BUCKET_SIZE`).
- **Status**: Full. Version monotonicity walks levels from deepest to 0 (matches spec's "snap before curr per level"), level-0 next check, version-12 branch in `validate_bucket_list_structure`.
- **Anchors**: `// Spec: CATCHUP_SPEC §3.1` at verify.rs:710, 727; `// Spec: CATCHUP_SPEC §4.4` at verify.rs:734.

### §4.5 — BucketList Hash
- **Claim §4.5-1**: Defined formula for v1 (live only) and v2 (`SHA256(liveHash || hotHash)`).
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/archive_state.rs:600-654` (`compute_bucket_list_hash`).
- **Status**: Full. v2 path concatenates live + hot hashes correctly; v1 returns live only.

### §5 — Publishing Pipeline

- **§5.1 incremental build**: `crates/history/src/checkpoint_builder.rs:344-437` — three dirty streams (ledger / transactions / results), `.dirty` suffix, fsync-on-write via `XdrStreamWriter`. **Full**.
- **§5.2 finalization**: `checkpoint_builder.rs:444-481` — durable rename per file, parent dir create_dir_all. **Full**.
- **§5.3 HAS queue**: `crates/history/src/publish_queue.rs` (SQLite-backed; spec describes file-backed `<seq>.checkpoint.dirty` / `<seq>.checkpoint`). **Documented intentional implementation difference**: storage shape differs from spec's filesystem queue, but the crash-recovery semantics are equivalent. The queue is node-local (never externally observable), so no behavioral divergence exists at the consensus or interoperability level — however, the on-disk representation differs for local tooling and manual inspection. Henyey's queue entries are committed atomically in the ledger-close DB transaction (no pending/dirty row state); stellar-core achieves the same via `writeCheckpointFile` + `maybeCheckpointComplete` rename. Restart cleanup (`db.remove_publish_above_lcl(lcl)`) mirrors `restoreCheckpoint()`. See `publish_queue.rs` module docs for the full semantic mapping.
- **§5.4 upload + delete_published_files (max 100)**: `crates/history/src/publish.rs:71-124`. **Full**.
- **§5.5 diff-buckets**: `crates/history/src/archive_state.rs:220-274`. **Full** — order matches spec ("snap, next-output, curr per level, top→bottom"), inhibit set seeded with all-zero hash.
- **§5.6 backpressure 8/16**: `crates/history/src/publish_queue.rs:108-112`, `crates/history/src/catchup/replay.rs:559-585`. **Full**. Hysteresis verified at `catchup/replay.rs:568-572`; named tests `test_publish_queue_max_size_is_16`, `test_publish_queue_hysteresis_invariant` lock in the values.
- **§5.7 crash recovery**: `crates/history/src/checkpoint_builder.rs:491-680`. **Full**. Recovers dirty files by truncating entries with `ledgerSeq > lcl`, durably renames back. The §5.7 "all three or none" partial-state rule is enforced by category-by-category cleanup loop.

### §6.1 — Catchup Modes
- **Claim §6.1-1** (MUST): modes are OFFLINE_BASIC, OFFLINE_COMPLETE, ONLINE.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/catchup_range.rs` defines `CatchupRunMode::{OfflineBasic, OfflineComplete, Online}` as the spec §6.1 discriminator, and `CatchupConfiguration` wrapping both `CatchupMode` (replay depth/count) and `CatchupRunMode`. The discriminator is threaded through `catchup_to_ledger_with_config` and all app-level entry points.
- **Status**: Full (structural). The enum exists and is correctly threaded. `OFFLINE_COMPLETE` tx-result verification loop (§12) remains gated by #2831 — the mode value is carried but does not yet trigger the additional verification behavior.
- **Notes**: `CatchupMode::{Minimal, Complete, Recent(n)}` remains the replay-depth/count axis (spec `count` field). The two axes are intentionally separate.

### §6.3 — Range Computation
- **Claim §6.3-1..5** (numbered cases): five mutually exclusive cases.
- **Rust**: `crates/history/src/catchup_range.rs:221-319`.
- **Status**: Partial. Henyey adds an extra Case 0 ("Complete from genesis → full replay") and Case 4b for completeness. The spec's Case 1 ("LCL > genesis → replay") is at line 259. Cases 2/3 are at lines 268-286. Case 4 (target start in first checkpoint) at 290-296.
- **Drift item**: spec §6.3 Case 1 says "Replay forward from LCL+1" unconditionally when `lcl > init`. Rust §6.3 collapses this with the post-#2677 invariant: bucket-apply only when LCL == genesis. This is documented in code (`catchup_range.rs:253-262`) and matches stellar-core CatchupRange.cpp:52-57 exactly. **Not a true drift — matches stellar-core; spec phrasing is just one of multiple valid factorings of the same five cases.**

### §8 — Catchup Pipeline
- **§8.1 fetch HAS**: `catchup/mod.rs:578-616` (`download_and_verify_has`), `:643-712` (`catchup_to_ledger`). **Full**.
- **§8.2 download + verify**: `catchup/mod.rs:540-545` (`download_verify_and_replay_with_retry`), `verify.rs:253-441` (`verify_reverse_walk`). **Full**.
- **§8.3 herder state restore**: not located in this crate. **Marked N/A** — herder/state coordination is in `crates/herder` / `crates/app`.
- **§8.4 apply buffered**: lives in `crates/app/src/app/ledger_close.rs:1758-1792`. **N/A**.
- **§8.5 post-apply asserts**: `catchup/mod.rs:463-486`. **Full**. Both (a) HAS/header seq agreement and (b) INV-C15 (`checkpoint_header.ledger_seq >= lcl_seq`).

### §9 — Ledger Chain Verification
- **§9.1 trust anchors**: `verify.rs:53-67` defines `TrustSource::{Scp{seq,hash}, None}` and `ChainTrustAnchors`. Call site at `catchup/replay.rs:235` always uses `TrustSource::None` because SCP-side hash plumbing is not wired through. **Partial**. The pure verification code path correctly implements the trusted-hash check (verify.rs:354-384); only the caller side does not yet provide a trusted hash.
- **§9.2 reverse-walk algorithm**: `verify.rs:253-441`. **Full**. Partitions into checkpoint groups, walks reverse, threads cross-checkpoint link, checks `previous_ledger_hash` continuity, LCL+1 link check (verify.rs:393-405).
- **§9.3 outcome → fatal**: `verify.rs:422-436`. **Full**. When `local_state_disagrees && TrustSource::Scp`, returns `FatalChainDisagreement`; with `TrustSource::None`, returns `InvalidPreviousHash` (retryable). Matches §9.3 table.

### §10 — Bucket Application
- **§10.1 download + verify**: bucket size cap at `catchup/download.rs:230-240`; per-bucket hash check at `catchup/buckets.rs:381-405`. **Full**.
- **§10.2 `containsValidBuckets`**: `archive_state.rs:749-790`, called at `catchup/buckets.rs:447-456` post-restore. **Full** (§10.2 says "before any application"; Rust runs it inside `apply_buckets` post-restore but before DB mutation — observable behavior identical).
- **§10.3 apply algorithm + newest-wins**: cross-crate (`crates/bucket/src/bucket_list.rs:1969-1989` + `manager.rs:850-890`). **N/A** for INV-C9 (see invariant table).
- **§10.4 index buckets**: indirect via `BucketList::restore_from_has` in `crates/bucket`. **Full**.
- **§10.5 AssumeState**: `catchup/buckets.rs:154-216` (`restart_merges`). **Full**.
- **§10.6 post-apply LCL setup + REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE clearing**: half present — `catchup/mod.rs:488-500` calls `ledger_manager.reset()` + `initialize()`. The `REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE` persistent-state flag itself is not located in this crate. **See §14.5 below.**

### §11 — Transaction Replay
- **§11.1 per-checkpoint workflow**: `catchup/replay.rs:460-552`. **Full**. After each apply: hash mismatch yields `ReplayHashMismatch`.
- **§11.2 five-case knit-to-LCL**: `catchup/replay.rs:58-117`. **Full**. Order of checks matches stellar-core's `ApplyCheckpointWork.cpp:246` (case 5 before case 4). Tests `test_knit_case_1..5` cover all branches.
- **§11.3 tx-set hash check**: `verify.rs:596-631` (`verify_tx_set`), called at `catchup/replay.rs:248-249`. **Full**. Mismatch produces `TxSetHashMismatch` with format diagnostic.
- **§11.4 backpressure**: `catchup/replay.rs:480-483, 559-585`. **Full**. Gated by `replay_config.wait_for_publish`.
- **§11.5 gaps**: tx_set is always available (synthesized for absent entries via `LedgerData::tx_set()`). Matches stellar-core. **Full**.

### §12 — Transaction Results Verification (OFFLINE_COMPLETE)
- **Claim §12-1..4** (MUST in OFFLINE_COMPLETE, SHALL NOT in OFFLINE_BASIC/ONLINE): for every non-genesis ledger, verify `sha256(xdr_to_opaque(L.txResultSet)) == L.header.txSetResultHash`; genesis ledger exempt iff results empty.
- **Rust**: `verify.rs:542-563` (`verify_tx_result_set`) and `verify.rs:808-842` (`verify_tx_result_ordering`) exist.
- **Status**: Partial. The verification *function* is correct and tested (`test_verify_tx_result_set_genesis_empty/nonempty/non_genesis_empty`), but it is called from `replay/execution.rs:680` during live replay — not from a separate `VerifyTxResultsWork`-equivalent that runs over the entire replay range in OFFLINE_COMPLETE mode. Henyey has no OFFLINE_COMPLETE entry point at all (see §6.1). The MUST-NOT clauses for OFFLINE_BASIC/ONLINE are trivially satisfied (no caller invokes the function in those modes), but the MUST clause for OFFLINE_COMPLETE has no caller because the mode does not exist as a configuration option.

### §14.5 — Catchup-side crash recovery
- **Claim §14.5-1**: `REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE` persistent-state flag must survive a crash during bucket apply; on restart, detect and re-trigger catchup.
- **Rust**: not located. `grep REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE` returns no hits. `grep "rebuild.*offer\|rebuild.*for"` in `crates/history/`, `crates/app/`, `crates/ledger/` returns nothing semantically equivalent.
- **Status**: Absent. **Verified by two search strategies**: (1) symbol grep across all crates for `REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE` and variants, (2) semantic search for "rebuild" / "offer table" / persistent-state flag patterns. Neither yields a flag clear/set pair at the documented commit boundary (`setLastClosedLedger` ↔ `clearRebuildForOfferTable`).
- **Risk**: a crash during bucket apply could leave the database in an inconsistent state without a forced re-catchup signal on restart. The risk is *partially* mitigated by `catchup/mod.rs:488-500` calling `reset() + initialize()` in a single visible transition, but there is no durable marker that the bucket apply was interrupted.
- **Recommendation**: file a follow-up to add a persistent-state flag (henyey-db key) with the same semantic role.

### §16 — Constants
All constants present with correct values:
- `CHECKPOINT_FREQUENCY = 64` at `checkpoint.rs:22` (with test override `ACCELERATED_CHECKPOINT_FREQUENCY = 8`).
- `MAX_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_BUCKET_SIZE = 100 * 1024^3` at `archive_state.rs:23`.
- `FIRST_PROTOCOL_SHADOWS_REMOVED = 12` at `archive_state.rs:378`.
- `GENESIS_LEDGER_SEQ = 1` at `catchup_range.rs:24`.
- `PUBLISH_QUEUE_MAX_SIZE = 16`, `PUBLISH_QUEUE_UNBLOCK_APPLICATION = 8` at `publish_queue.rs:108-112`.
- `MAX_DELETE_CHECKPOINTS = 100` at `publish.rs:71` (named `MAX_PUBLISH_DELETE_CHECKPOINTS` in spec — naming drift, value matches).
- `FIRST_PROTOCOL_SUPPORTING_PERSISTENT_EVICTION = 23`: not located as a named constant; logic at `publish.rs:295` (`version = if hot_archive_buckets.is_some() { 2 } else { 1 }`) is the structural equivalent. **Naming drift**, semantic Full.
- `LIVE_BUCKETLIST_LEVELS = 11`: re-exported from `henyey_bucket::BUCKET_LIST_LEVELS`; same value.
- `HOT_ARCHIVE_BUCKETLIST_LEVELS`: re-exported from `henyey_bucket::HOT_ARCHIVE_BUCKET_LIST_LEVELS`.
- `MAX_EXTERNALIZE_LEDGER_APPLY_DRIFT = 12`: not located in this crate. Lives in `crates/app` if at all — N/A here.
- `CONDITIONAL_APPLY_POLL_INTERVAL = 500 ms`: not located. Replay loop in `catchup/replay.rs:583` sleeps 1 second between backpressure polls (drift in interval); the spec §11.1 pre-apply merge wait at 500 ms is N/A here (lives in caller / `crates/bucket`).

## Invariant Coverage

| Invariant | Status | Enforcement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| INV-C1 (Chain monotonic) | Full | `verify.rs:312-332` (forward link within group), `verify.rs:515-530` (`verify_ledger_header_history_entry` hashes header). |
| INV-C2 (Checkpoint alignment) | Full | `verify.rs:282-292` (group partition by checkpoint); checkpoint ledger range enforced via `verify_tx_result_ordering` (`verify.rs:808-842`). |
| INV-C3 (HAS integrity) | Full | `verify.rs:709-761` + `archive_state.rs:404-473`. |
| INV-C4 (BucketList hash agreement) | Full | `verify.rs:480-494` (`verify_ledger_hash`) + `archive_state.rs:600-654` (`compute_bucket_list_hash`). |
| INV-C5 (Trust anchor authentication) | Partial | Verification function supports `TrustSource::Scp` (`verify.rs:355-384`), but call site uses `TrustSource::None` (`catchup/replay.rs:235`). Internal-only verification still flags LCL disagreement as fatal-via-`InvalidPreviousHash` retry, but no SCP-side trusted hash is plumbed. |
| INV-C6 (Tx result hash check) | Partial | `verify_tx_result_set` correct (`verify.rs:542-563`) but no `OFFLINE_COMPLETE`-mode caller that loops over every replay-range ledger. See §12. |
| INV-C7 (Knit-to-LCL exclusivity) | Full | `catchup/replay.rs:58-117` — five mutually-exclusive cases; case 5 returns `KnitOvershot` error (fatal). |
| INV-C8 (Buffered drain ordering) | N/A | Lives in `crates/app/src/app/ledger_close.rs:1758-1792` (`try_apply_buffered_ledgers` only advances `next_seq = current + 1`; gap stops the chain). |
| INV-C9 (Bucket-apply newest wins) | N/A | Lives in `crates/bucket/src/bucket_list.rs:1969-1989` and `crates/bucket/src/manager.rs:850-890` (`seen_keys` HashSet, shallowest-first traversal). |
| INV-C10 (Publish file finalization boundary) | Full | `checkpoint_builder.rs:444-481` rename happens only after caller passes the checkpoint ledger; `recover_dirty_file` (`:135-225`) truncates `ledgerSeq > lcl` on restart. |
| INV-C11 (Publish queue durability) | Full | `publish_queue.rs` (SQLite-backed; row-level atomic); on restart, queue rows survive iff their transaction committed. Storage shape differs from spec's filename-based scheme but provides equivalent crash-recovery semantics (documented intentional difference — see §5.3 drift item). |
| INV-C12 (No retry on fatal) | N/A | Lives in `crates/app/src/app/mod.rs:557` (`fatal_state_failure: AtomicBool`); checked at `crates/app/src/app/ledger_close.rs:1801` and `crates/app/src/app/catchup_impl.rs:55,1642`. |
| INV-C13 (Range exclusivity) | Full | `catchup_range.rs:155-208` enum encodes the three cases (`ReplayOnly` / `BucketApplyAndReplay` / `BucketsOnly`) at the type level; `buckets_and_replay` enforces `checkpoint + 1 == replay.first` via assert (line 202-206). |
| INV-C14 (Replay determinism) | Full | Replay always goes through `ledger_manager.close_ledger()` (`catchup/replay.rs:516-531`), the same path as live close, with `expected_header_hash` propagated and verified (`catchup/replay.rs:489-501, 519-525`). Determinism property held by `crates/ledger`. |
| INV-C15 (Catchup never applies older state) | Full | `catchup/mod.rs:473-486` explicitly checks `checkpoint_header.ledger_seq >= lcl_seq` before any DB mutation; produces `VerificationFailed` with the INV-C15 label. Additionally guarded at the type level by `catchup_range.rs:253-262` (bucket-apply only on LCL == genesis path). |

## Drift Items (human review)

1. **§5.3 HAS publish queue storage shape** *(Documented intentional difference)*: spec describes a filesystem of `<seq>.checkpoint` and `<seq>.checkpoint.dirty` files; Rust uses a SQLite `publishqueue` table (`publish_queue.rs`). The durability semantics are equivalent for crash-recovery purposes (transactional commit replaces durable rename), and the queue is node-local (never exposed in archives or externally observable). However, the on-disk storage shape still differs from the spec's filesystem model, which matters for local operational tooling, debugging, and manual inspection. **Documented in-repo** as an intentional implementation difference — see `publish_queue.rs` module docs, `README.md` design note, and `PARITY_STATUS.md` architectural difference #3. No code change required.

2. **§6.3 Case 1 / post-#2677 invariant**: Rust collapses spec's five-case range computation into a slightly different factoring (Case 0 for Complete-from-genesis, Case 1 unconditional replay when LCL > genesis, Case 4b for first-checkpoint targets). The factoring is documented at `catchup_range.rs:240-262` and stated to match stellar-core CatchupRange.cpp:52-57 exactly. **Not a true drift — request a spec-side update to make the factoring explicit, citing PR #2677.**

## Recommendations

1. **~~Add OFFLINE_BASIC / OFFLINE_COMPLETE / ONLINE mode discriminator~~** ✅ Done (#2829). Wire OFFLINE_COMPLETE to a `verify_results_for_range` work that loops over `results-*.xdr.gz` files for every checkpoint in the replay range, invoking `verify_tx_result_set` per ledger. Closes the §12 / INV-C6 gap (#2831).
2. **Plumb SCP-side trusted hash through** to `catchup/replay.rs:235` so `TrustSource::Scp` is actually exercised in ONLINE mode. Closes the INV-C5 gap (currently relies on internal-only chain consistency).
3. **Add a `REBUILD_FOR_OFFER_TABLE`-equivalent persistent-state flag** (henyey-db row) cleared by the same code that calls `setLastClosedLedger` at the end of bucket apply. Closes the §14.5 gap.
4. ~~**Update spec §5.3** to acknowledge SQLite-backed publish queue as a conforming alternative storage shape (or vice versa, if filesystem-backed is required for stellar-core interoperability).~~ *(No spec update needed — documented in-repo as intentional implementation difference; queue is node-local. Tracked as Drift 1 above.)*
5. **Update spec §6.3** to make the post-#2677 collapsed factoring of Case 1 / Case 2 / Case 4b explicit, eliminating the apparent drift.
