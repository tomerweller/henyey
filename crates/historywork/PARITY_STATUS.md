## Intentional Omissions

Features excluded by design. These are NOT counted against parity %.

| stellar-core Component | Reason |
|------------------------|--------|
| `RunCommandWork` | Rust uses native async I/O instead of subprocess-driven shell commands |
| `GetRemoteFileWork` | HTTP download handled by `reqwest` in `henyey-history` |
| `GetAndUnzipRemoteFileWork` | Download + decompress performed natively with `flate2`, not chained shell work |
| `GunzipFileWork` | Decompression uses `flate2` crate instead of `gunzip` subprocesses |
| `GzipFileWork` | Compression uses `flate2` crate instead of `gzip` subprocesses |
| `PutRemoteFileWork` | Upload abstracted behind the `ArchiveWriter` trait in `henyey-history` |
| `MakeRemoteDirWork` | Archive writer implementations create directories implicitly |

## Gaps

Features not yet implemented. These ARE counted against parity %.

| stellar-core Component | Priority | Notes |
|------------------------|----------|-------|
| `CheckSingleLedgerHeaderWork` | Low | Offline self-check command; not needed for catchup or watcher |
| `DownloadVerifyTxResultsWork` | Medium | Checkpoint-range tx result download+verify orchestration |
| `FetchRecentQsetsWork` | Low | SCP quorum-set bootstrap fetcher; not needed for current workflows |
| `PublishWork` | Medium | Top-level publish orchestration and callbacks |
| `PutFilesWork` | Medium | Differential upload against remote HAS |
| `PutHistoryArchiveStateWork` | Medium | Publishing HAS JSON to archive |
| `PutSnapshotFilesWork` | Medium | Snapshot gzip/upload pipeline |
| `ResolveSnapshotWork` | Medium | Snapshot bucket-reference resolution |
| `WriteSnapshotWork` | Medium | Live-state snapshot writer for publish workflow |
| `WriteVerifiedCheckpointHashesWork` | Low | Offline verified hash-chain export tool |

## Architectural Differences

1. **Transport and compression**
   - **stellar-core**: Builds history tasks from shell-command work items (`curl`, `gzip`, `gunzip`) via `RunCommandWork`.
   - **Rust**: Uses native HTTP (`reqwest`) and compression (`flate2`) libraries directly inside async work items.
   - **Rationale**: Avoids subprocess overhead and integrates naturally with the tokio-based scheduler.

2. **Work scheduling model**
   - **stellar-core**: Uses `Work`/`BatchWork`/`WorkSequence` state machines with child-work spawning and cranking.
   - **Rust**: Registers work items as an explicit DAG via `HistoryWorkBuilder` + `WorkScheduler`.
   - **Rationale**: Makes dependency ordering explicit and composable without nested state machines.

3. **Shared state vs. return values**
   - **stellar-core**: Each work item stores results internally; callers access them via getters after completion.
   - **Rust**: All work items write to a shared `HistoryWorkState` behind an `Arc<Mutex<...>>`.
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies data flow in a DAG scheduler where work items don't have parent-child relationships.

4. **Bucket handling**
   - **stellar-core**: `VerifyBucketWork` verifies hashes and builds bucket indexes, then `DownloadBucketsWork::onSuccessCb` adopts buckets into `BucketManager`.
   - **Rust**: `download_and_save_bucket` verifies hashes and saves files to disk; bucket-manager adoption is handled separately during catchup.
   - **Rationale**: Bucket index building is a BucketManager concern; the download work only needs verified files on disk.

5. **Publish vs. download focus**
   - **stellar-core**: The `historywork` directory covers both download (catchup) and publish (archiver) workflows.
   - **Rust**: `henyey-historywork` currently implements only the download/verification side.
   - **Rationale**: Current use cases (watcher, catchup, offline verification) require only downloads. Publish pipeline will be added when archiver support is needed.

## Test Coverage

| Area | stellar-core Tests | Rust Tests | Notes |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Verified checkpoint hashes | 1 TEST_CASE / 2 SECTION | 0 `#[test]` | Feature not implemented in Rust |
| Single ledger header check | 1 TEST_CASE / 0 SECTION | 0 `#[test]` | Feature not implemented in Rust |
| Download work chain | Indirect via CatchupSimulation | 1 `#[tokio::test]` | `history_work.rs` exercises full download DAG |
| Checkpoint data assembly | — | 2 `#[tokio::test]` | `checkpoint_data.rs` covers success and failure paths |
| Retry constants | — | 2 `#[test]` | Verifies RETRY_A_FEW=5 and RETRY_A_LOT=32 match upstream |

### Test Gaps

- `WriteVerifiedCheckpointHashesWork` has upstream acceptance-level tests (1 TEST_CASE / 2 SECTION) with no Rust equivalent.
- `CheckSingleLedgerHeaderWork` has an upstream test (1 TEST_CASE) with no Rust equivalent.
- The full publish pipeline (snapshot write, resolve, upload) has no Rust implementation or tests.
- No dedicated error-path or retry-behavior tests for individual download work items.
