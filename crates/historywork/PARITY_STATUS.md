## Intentional Omissions

Features excluded by design. These are NOT counted against parity %.

| stellar-core Component | Reason |
|------------------------|--------|
| `RunCommandWork` | Shell command execution base class; Rust uses native async libraries instead of spawning shell processes |
| `GetRemoteFileWork` | HTTP download via curl/wget shell commands; replaced by `reqwest` in `henyey-history` crate |
| `GetAndUnzipRemoteFileWork` | Download + gunzip via shell commands; replaced by async HTTP + `flate2` in-memory decompression |
| `GunzipFileWork` | Decompression via shell `gunzip`; replaced by `flate2` crate |
| `GzipFileWork` | Compression via shell `gzip`; replaced by `flate2` crate (`gzip_bytes()`) |
| `PutRemoteFileWork` | File upload via shell commands; replaced by `ArchiveWriter` trait abstraction |
| `MakeRemoteDirWork` | Remote directory creation via shell commands; handled by `ArchiveWriter` implementations |

## Gaps

Features not yet implemented. These ARE counted against parity %.

| stellar-core Component | Priority | Notes |
|------------------------|----------|-------|
| `WriteSnapshotWork` | Medium | Writes current node state snapshot to disk for archival publishing; needed for archiving nodes |
| `ResolveSnapshotWork` | Medium | Resolves bucket references in a state snapshot; needed for archival publishing |
| `PutFilesWork` | Medium | Differential file upload (only uploads files not already in remote archive); needed for efficient archival publishing |
| `PutSnapshotFilesWork` | Medium | Orchestrates full snapshot publish pipeline (get remote state, gzip, upload); needed for archiving nodes |
| `PublishWork` | Medium | Top-level publish orchestration with success/failure callbacks to HistoryManager; needed for archiving nodes |
| `WriteVerifiedCheckpointHashesWork` | Low | Offline verification tool that downloads full ledger chain and writes verified hashes to JSON file |
| `FetchRecentQsetsWork` | Low | Downloads recent SCP history to extract quorum sets for network bootstrap |

## Architectural Differences

1. **File Downloads**
   - **stellar-core**: Shell commands (`curl`, `wget`) via `RunCommandWork` subprocess execution
   - **Rust**: Native async HTTP via `reqwest` in `henyey-history` crate
   - **Rationale**: Eliminates subprocess overhead and provides native async integration with tokio runtime

2. **Compression**
   - **stellar-core**: Shell commands (`gzip`, `gunzip`) via separate work items (`GzipFileWork`, `GunzipFileWork`)
   - **Rust**: In-memory compression/decompression via `flate2` crate
   - **Rationale**: Avoids file I/O round-trips and subprocess overhead; `gzip_bytes()` operates on byte slices directly

3. **Bucket Storage**
   - **stellar-core**: Files on disk with bucket indexing via `BucketManager.adoptFileAsBucket()`; `VerifyBucketWork` spawns background thread to verify and build index
   - **Rust**: Raw bucket files on disk (`<hash>.bucket.xdr` in configurable directory); hash verification inline during download, no index building
   - **Rationale**: Index building will be needed for full BucketManager parity but is not required for basic catchup

4. **Work Orchestration**
   - **stellar-core**: `BasicWork`/`Work`/`BatchWork` class hierarchy with state machine (`WORK_RUNNING`, `WORK_SUCCESS`, etc.) and child work management
   - **Rust**: `Work` trait with `WorkScheduler` DAG; dependencies expressed as work IDs; builders (`HistoryWorkBuilder`, `BatchDownloadWorkBuilder`) register work with proper ordering
   - **Rationale**: DAG-based scheduling is more explicit about dependencies and avoids state machine complexity

5. **Background Work**
   - **stellar-core**: `postOnBackgroundThread` for CPU-intensive tasks (bucket verification, snapshot writing)
   - **Rust**: All operations are async; no dedicated background threads
   - **Rationale**: tokio's task system provides equivalent concurrency without explicit thread management

6. **Publish Pipeline**
   - **stellar-core**: Multi-step snapshot pipeline: `WriteSnapshotWork` -> `ResolveSnapshotWork` -> `PutSnapshotFilesWork` (which does differential upload via `PutFilesWork`)
   - **Rust**: Individual publish work items (`PublishBucketsWork`, `PublishLedgerHeadersWork`, etc.) that publish from downloaded state via `ArchiveWriter` trait
   - **Rationale**: Current Rust implementation supports archive mirroring; full archiving-node publish from live state is not yet implemented

7. **Archive Selection**
   - **stellar-core**: Random archive selection on retry; `GetRemoteFileWork` picks a different archive each attempt
   - **Rust**: Single archive per work builder; retry uses same archive
   - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation; archive failover can be added at the `HistoryArchive` level

## Test Coverage

| Area | stellar-core Tests | Rust Tests | Notes |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Verified checkpoint hashes | 1 TEST_CASE / 2 SECTION | 0 #[test] | `WriteVerifiedCheckpointHashesWork` not implemented |
| Single ledger header check | 1 TEST_CASE / 0 SECTION | 0 #[test] | Upstream tests; no direct Rust equivalent but functionality is tested via integration |
| Checkpoint range | -- | 3 #[test] | `test_checkpoint_range_count`, `_iter`, `_ledger_range` |
| File type / progress | -- | 2 #[test] | `test_history_file_type_display`, `test_batch_download_progress_message` |
| Well-known path | -- | 1 #[test] | `test_well_known_stellar_history_path` |
| Integration (download) | Part of `CatchupSimulation` | 1 #[tokio::test] in `history_work.rs` | Rust has end-to-end test |
| State assembly | -- | 2 #[tokio::test] in `checkpoint_data.rs` | Basic state tests |

### Test Gaps

- **WriteVerifiedCheckpointHashesWork tests**: Upstream has 1 TEST_CASE with 2 SECTIONs for offline verification; functionality not implemented in Rust.
- **CheckSingleLedgerHeaderWork tests**: Upstream has 1 TEST_CASE; Rust has no direct unit test but the work item is exercised in integration tests.
- **CatchupSimulation-level tests**: stellar-core has elaborate simulation framework tests that exercise the full catchup pipeline including history work items; Rust has a simpler integration test.
