/// A dependency-aware async work scheduler.
///
/// The scheduler manages a collection of work items, tracks their dependencies,
/// and executes them concurrently (up to a configured limit). It handles:
///
/// - **Dependency ordering**: Work items only run after all their dependencies succeed.
/// - **Concurrency control**: Limits the number of simultaneously running work items.
/// - **Automatic retries**: Retries work items that request it, with configurable delays.
/// - **Cancellation propagation**: Cancels all work items when requested.
/// - **Failure isolation**: Blocks dependent work when a dependency fails.
///
/// # Design
///
/// The scheduler is modeled after the work scheduling system in stellar-core.
/// It uses a simple ready-queue approach: work items whose dependencies have all
/// succeeded are eligible for execution. The scheduler spawns Tokio tasks for each
/// work item and collects completion notifications via an internal channel.
///
/// The execution loop follows these steps:
/// 1. Fill available concurrency slots with ready work items
/// 2. Wait for any running work to complete
/// 3. Process the completion and update state accordingly
/// 4. Repeat until no work can make progress
///
/// # Ownership
///
/// Work items are moved into the scheduler and remain there until the scheduler
/// is dropped. The scheduler temporarily takes work items out during execution
/// (setting the field to `None`) and restores them after completion. This design
/// satisfies Rust's ownership rules while allowing stateful work items to be
/// retried.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use henyey_work::{WorkScheduler, WorkSchedulerConfig, Work, WorkOutcome, WorkContext};
///
/// // Create scheduler with custom configuration
/// let mut scheduler = WorkScheduler::new(WorkSchedulerConfig {
///     max_concurrency: 4,
///     retry_delay: Duration::from_secs(1),
///     event_tx: None,
/// });
///
/// // Add work items with dependencies
/// let id1 = scheduler.add_work(Box::new(work1), vec![], 3);
/// let id2 = scheduler.add_work(Box::new(work2), vec![id1], 0); // depends on id1
///
/// // Run until all work completes or is blocked
/// scheduler.run_until_done().await;
///
/// // Check results
/// assert_eq!(scheduler.state(id1), Some(WorkState::Success));
