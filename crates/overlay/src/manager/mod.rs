//! Overlay manager for coordinating peer connections and message routing.
//!
//! The [`OverlayManager`] is the primary interface for the overlay network subsystem.
//! It handles all aspects of peer-to-peer networking:
//!
//! - **Connection Management**: Establishes and maintains TCP connections to peers,
//!   respecting configured limits for inbound and outbound connections
//!
//! - **Peer Discovery**: Learns about new peers from connected nodes and maintains
//!   a pool of known addresses to connect to
//!
//! - **Message Routing**: Receives messages from peers and distributes them to
//!   subscribers, while also sending outbound messages to appropriate peers
//!
//! - **Flood Control**: Uses the [`FloodGate`] to prevent duplicate message
//!   propagation while ensuring all peers receive new messages
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The manager runs several background tasks:
//!
//! 1. **Listener task**: Accepts incoming connections (if enabled)
//! 2. **Connector task**: Initiates outbound connections to maintain target peer count
//! 3. **Peer tasks**: One per connected peer, handles message I/O
//! 4. **Advertiser task**: Periodically sends peer lists to connected nodes
//!
//! # Flow Control
//!
//! The overlay implements Stellar's flow control protocol using `SendMore` and
//! `SendMoreExtended` messages. This prevents peers from overwhelming each other
//! with messages during high-traffic periods.
//!
//! [`FloodGate`]: crate::FloodGate
