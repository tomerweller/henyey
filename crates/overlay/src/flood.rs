//! Flood gate for managing message propagation and duplicate detection.
//!
//! The Stellar overlay network propagates certain message types (transactions,
//! SCP messages, etc.) to all connected peers. To prevent infinite loops and
//! reduce bandwidth, the [`FloodGate`] tracks which messages have been seen
//! and from which peers.
//!
//! # Functionality
//!
//! - **Duplicate Detection**: Messages are identified by their BLAKE2b-256 hash
//!   (matching stellar-core's `xdrBlake2`). If we've seen a message before, it's not flooded again.
//!
//! - **Peer Tracking**: Records which peers have sent each message, so we
//!   don't forward messages back to peers that already have them.
//!
//! - **Ledger-boundary Cleanup**: Entries are removed at ledger close via
//!   [`FloodGate::clear_below`], matching stellar-core's `clearBelow()`.
//!   A secondary TTL check removes stale entries as a defensive measure.
//!
//! - **Rate Limiting**: Soft limit on messages per second to prevent
//!   overwhelming the node during traffic spikes.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! All seen-message state is unified in a single [`EvictingSeenMap`] behind a
//! `Mutex`. This eliminates the split-state complexity of the previous design
//! (separate DashMap + VecDeque + generation tokens). Eviction order is
//! approximate FIFO via `IndexMap` insertion order.
