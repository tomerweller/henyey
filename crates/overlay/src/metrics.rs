//! Overlay network metrics collection.
//!
//! This module implements the OverlayMetrics from stellar-core, providing
//! comprehensive metrics for monitoring overlay network operations.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Metrics are organized into categories:
//!
//! - **Message metrics**: Counts of messages read, written, dropped
//! - **Byte metrics**: Bytes read and written
//! - **Error metrics**: Read and write errors
//! - **Timeout metrics**: Idle and straggler timeouts
//! - **Connection metrics**: Pending and authenticated peer counts
//! - **Send counters**: Counts per message type sent
//! - **Queue metrics**: Outbound queue drops
//! - **Flood metrics**: Transaction flooding statistics
//! - **Fetch metrics**: Item fetcher statistics
//! - **Pull metrics**: Demand timeouts and pulled transaction counts
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All metrics use atomic operations and are safe to access from multiple threads.
