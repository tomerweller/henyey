# Soroban Execution Optimization Plan

## Problem Statement

Henyey's ledger close time is 1.88x slower than stellar-core v25.2.0 on the same
hardware, same ledger range. The gap is **149ms** per ledger (317.5ms vs 168.5ms).

**Current status**: After Steps 1–2 + 4. A/B benchmark on 1000 ledgers (61349000–61350000)
shows Step 4 reduced mean from **586.9ms → 346.1ms** (−41%), a **240.8ms** improvement.
The large delta suggests the baseline also includes gains from commit `6ecd777` (incremental
mutation tracking refinement). Remaining optimization targets: executor setup (10.5ms),
fee_seq (15ms), meta construction (15-25ms).

## Root Cause

Linear regression on 136 mainnet ledgers (61349505–61349640) decomposes the gap:

| Component | stellar-core | henyey | Gap at mean workload |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Per classic-op | 0.023ms | 0.054ms | +16ms (2.4x) |
| Per soroban-op | 0.241ms | 0.830ms | +152ms (3.5x) |
| Fixed overhead | 95.4ms | 77.0ms | −18ms |
| **Total** | **168.5ms** | **317.5ms** | **+149ms** |

**Soroban per-op cost is 3.5x slower, accounting for 152ms of the 149ms gap.**

Mean workload per ledger: ~500 classic ops, ~257 soroban ops (~130 soroban TXs).

## Profiling Breakdown

Granular profiling (Step 1 commit `a1db12f`, `RUST_LOG=debug` on release build)
reveals where per-Soroban-TX time goes:

### Per Soroban TX (~1100μs total, ~130 TXs/ledger = ~143ms)

| Component | Avg (μs) | % | Per ledger | Optimizable? |
|-----------|---------|---|------------|--------------|
| e2e_invoke (WASM host) | 360 | 33% | 47ms | No (upstream soroban-env-host) |
| Per-op bookkeeping | 480 | 44% | 62ms | Partially — see lessons learned |
| fee_seq (fees, seq bump, signers) | 112 | 10% | 15ms | Partially |
| apply_storage_changes | 69 | 6% | 9ms | Partially |
| validation | 71 | 6% | 9ms | Partially |
| footprint loading | 45 | 4% | 6ms | Minor |
| XDR encode + extract | 45 | 4% | 6ms | Not worth it |

**Per-op bookkeeping** is the per-operation overhead in `execute_single_transaction`:
2× `delta_snapshot()`, `delta_changes_between()`, `flush_modified_entries()`,
`begin_op_snapshot()` / `end_op_snapshot()`, savepoint management, entry change
building with state overrides. For Soroban TXs with exactly 1 operation, much of
this bookkeeping is redundant — the "operation changes" ARE the "transaction changes".

### Per-ledger setup/teardown (~36ms)

| Component | Time | Optimizable? |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| executor_setup (HashMap retain for offers) | 10.5ms | ✅ Fixed (Step 3 — offer/non-offer map split) |
| post_exec (fee event generation) | 7.9ms | ✅ Fixed (Step 4 — reuses prepared TX data) |
| tx_parse (XDR deserialization) | 7.4ms | ✅ Fixed (Step 4 — single prepare() call) |
| fee_deduct + preload | 5.0ms | Minor |
| phase_parse (soroban phase structure) | 4.4ms | ✅ Fixed (Step 4 — single prepare() call) |

### What's NOT the bottleneck

- **XDR entry serialization** (encode + extract): Only 45μs/TX total (6ms/ledger).
  For P25, `disk_read_bytes_exceeded` skips Soroban entries entirely — no duplicate
  serialization. The original plan's Steps 2–3 targeted this, but they would yield <6ms.
- **e2e_invoke host execution**: 360μs/TX (47ms/ledger). This is the upstream
  soroban-env-host crate — same Rust code as stellar-core. Cannot be optimized here.
- **`build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive` micro-optimizations**: Debug logging removal,
  `Vec<u8>` → `LedgerKey` keys, lazy HashMap, O(1) dedup — yielded 0ms measurable
  gain (see Step 2b). The function's cost is dominated by entry cloning and state
  lookups, not by key hashing or linear scans.

---

## Benchmark Protocol

All measurements use:
- **Binary**: release build (`cargo build --release --bin henyey -p henyey`)
- **Range**: `verify-execution --from 61349000 --to 61350000` (1000 closes, protocol 25)
- **Cache**: `--cache-dir ~/data/<session>/cache` (pre-warmed from prior run)
- **Logging**: `RUST_LOG=info` for timing, `RUST_LOG=debug` for phase breakdown
- **Machine**: same host for all runs (no cross-machine comparisons)
- **A/B method**: Build baseline and optimized binaries, run back-to-back on same
  1000-ledger range in a single session to minimize system load variance

### Baseline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean | 317.5ms |
| p50 | 385ms |
| p95 | 507ms |
| stellar-core reference | 168.5ms mean |

### Acceptance Criteria

The optimization is considered successful when:

1. **Performance**: Mean ledger close ≤ 220ms on the benchmark range (1.3x stellar-core)
2. **Correctness**: Hash parity on ≥1000 consecutive mainnet ledgers with `verify-execution`
3. **No RSS regression**: Peak RSS increase ≤ 200MB over baseline
4. **All tests pass**: `cargo test --all` + `cargo clippy --all` clean

Stretch goal: ≤ 190ms mean (1.13x stellar-core).

## Optimization Steps

### Step 1: TTL Key Hash Caching ✅ DONE

**Commit**: `a1db12f` | **Result**: −10.4ms (307.1ms)

Built `TtlKeyCache` (`HashMap<LedgerKey, Hash>`) during `load_soroban_footprint`,
threaded it through all Soroban validation/execution functions. Eliminates ~15K
redundant `key.to_xdr() + SHA256` computations per ledger.

Original estimate was −60 to −80ms. Actual: −10.4ms. SHA-256 of small keys
(~100-200 bytes) takes <1μs each — the hash computation was never the real
bottleneck. The profiling done after this step revealed the true cost structure
(see Profiling Breakdown above).

---

### Step 2: Incremental Mutation Tracking ✅ DONE (below expectations)

**Commit**: `b74e111` | **Result**: −3.5ms (303.6ms)

Two sub-optimizations targeting per-op bookkeeping:

**A) Zero-copy DeltaSlice**: Replaced `DeltaChanges` (5 owned `Vec`s cloned per
call via `.to_vec()`) with `DeltaSlice<'a>` holding range indices into the parent
`LedgerDelta`, returning `&[T]` slices on demand. Eliminates allocations at the
2 hot-path call sites (fee charging, per-op loop).

**B) Skip savepoint for single-op TXs**: For TXs with exactly 1 operation (all
Soroban, many classic), skip `create_savepoint()` since TX-level rollback handles
failures. Guarded `rollback_to_savepoint()` with `Option`.

**Why it underperformed** (original estimate: −30 to −50ms):

Targeted profiling with per-call instrumentation revealed the original sampled
profiling grossly overestimated costs:

| Operation | Estimated per-call | Actual per-call (Soroban) | Actual per-call (classic) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `create_savepoint()` | 100-150μs | **~2μs** | 30-120μs |
| `delta_changes_between()` | 30-50μs | **<1μs** | varies |

Root cause: Soroban TXs have tiny state (few modified entries) → savepoint clones
near-empty maps, `.to_vec()` copies 1-3 element vectors. The 480μs/TX estimate from
sampling profiler was primarily attributable to `build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive`
(60-100μs/TX, 15-25ms/ledger), not to delta cloning or savepoints.

Per-ledger phase breakdown (busy ledger, ~250 TXs, ~200 Soroban):

| Phase | Per-ledger cost |
|-------|----------------|
| `create_savepoint` (Soroban, skippable) | 0.3-1.0ms |
| `create_savepoint` (classic, required) | 2-5ms |
| `flush_modified_entries` | 0.3-0.8ms |
| `change_order` alloc | ~0ms |
| `build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive` | **15-25ms** |

The changes are correct and harmless but deliver only ~3.5ms of the estimated
30-50ms. The real per-op bookkeeping bottleneck is meta construction
(`build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive`).

---

### Step 2b: Meta Construction Micro-Optimizations ✅ DONE (no measurable gain)

**Commit**: `3b48532` | **Result**: ~0ms (303.6ms → 312ms, within noise)

Five targeted optimizations to `build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive`:

1. **Removed debug logging** — 7 debug loops, inline TTL traces, `entry_type_name`
   helper, `build_transaction_meta` debug log (-227 lines)
2. **Lazy `final_updated` HashMap** — moved into fallback branch (Soroban/classic
   change_order paths never used it)
3. **`Vec<u8>` → `LedgerKey` keys** — eliminated `entry_key_bytes()` (XDR serialize
   per key). `created_keys`, `seen_keys`, `final_updated` now use `LedgerKey` directly
4. **O(1) `already_processed` check** — replaced O(n×m) `changes.iter().any()` with
   `HashSet<LedgerKey>` for live_bucket_list_entries/hot_archive_entries loops
5. **Pre-computed key passing** — `push_created_or_restored` accepts `&LedgerKey`

Benchmark (3 runs, median): 312.15ms. No improvement over 303.6ms baseline.

**Why it didn't help**: The function's cost is dominated by `LedgerEntry` cloning
(each change pushes `.clone()`) and snapshot state lookups, not by key hashing or
linear scans. The O(n×m) `already_processed` check only fires for restore operations
(rare). Debug logging with `tracing::debug!` at `RUST_LOG=info` short-circuits
after a single bool check — the loop iteration overhead was negligible.

**Lesson learned**: Micro-optimizing data structures within a function rarely helps
when the dominant cost is entry cloning and I/O. The 15-25ms/ledger attributed to
this function likely reflects the cost of building `Vec<LedgerEntryChange>` with
cloned entries — fundamentally required for correctness. Further optimization would
require structural changes (e.g., avoiding entry clones via `Arc<LedgerEntry>` or
building meta lazily/on-demand).

---

### Step 3: Executor Setup — Offer/Non-Offer Map Split ✅ DONE

**Commit**: `0edb0d4` | **Result**: −8.83ms (A/B on 1000 ledgers)

Split `entry_sponsorships`, `entry_sponsorship_ext`, and `entry_last_modified` into
offer-specific and non-offer maps. On `clear_cached_entries_preserving_offers()`,
non-offer maps call `.clear()` (O(1)) instead of `.retain()` (O(n) scan).

Added `is_offer_key()` routing and helper methods (`get_entry_sponsorship`,
`insert_entry_sponsorship`, etc.) to abstract the split. Updated all access points
in `entries.rs`, `sponsorship.rs`, and rollback/savepoint logic in `mod.rs`.

**A/B benchmark** (1000 ledgers, 61349000–61350000):

| | Step 4 only | Step 4 + Step 3 | Delta |
|--|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Average per ledger | 337.05ms | 328.22ms | −8.83ms (−2.6%) |
| tx_exec | 302.08ms | 294.70ms | −7.38ms |

**Files modified**:
- `crates/tx/src/state/mod.rs` — split maps, helpers, updated clear/rollback/savepoint
- `crates/tx/src/state/entries.rs` — routed via helpers
- `crates/tx/src/state/sponsorship.rs` — routed via helpers

---

### Step 4: Unified TX Set Parsing ✅ DONE

**Result**: Structural improvement (eliminates 5 redundant TX set parses).

**Problem**: Five separate passes parse the `GeneralizedTransactionSet`:
1. `transactions_with_base_fee()` — hash + sort + clone all TXs
2. `soroban_phase_structure()` — hash + sort stages/clusters
3. `classic_phase_transactions()` — hash + sort classic TXs
4. Post-exec fee events — `transactions_with_base_fee()` again + `TransactionFrame` per TX
5. Post-exec perf data — `transactions_with_base_fee()` again + `TransactionFrame` per TX

Each call recomputes the TX set hash (full XDR serialize + SHA-256) and re-sorts.

**Solution**: Added `PreparedTxSet` struct in `close.rs` with single-pass `prepare()`:
- `hash`: computed once via `self.hash()`
- `classic_txs`: sorted classic phase TXs
- `soroban_phase`: pre-parsed `SorobanPhaseStructure` (if present)
- `all_txs`: flat ordered list (classic + soroban flattened)
- `tx_meta`: per-TX `fee_source` and `is_soroban` (avoids `TransactionFrame` construction)

All 5 call sites in `apply_transactions()` replaced with reads from `prepared`.

**Files modified**:
- `crates/ledger/src/close.rs` — added `PreparedTxSet`, `TxMeta`, `envelope_is_soroban()`, `prepare()`
- `crates/ledger/src/manager.rs` — replaced 5 parsing calls with single `prepared`
- `crates/ledger/src/execution/mod.rs` — made `fee_source_account_id()` `pub(crate)`

**Benchmark** (A/B, 1000 ledgers 61349000–61350000, same session back-to-back):

| | Baseline (`6ecd777`) | Optimized (`3f8a47f`) | Delta |
|--|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Average per ledger | 586.91ms | 346.07ms | −240.84ms (−41%) |
| close_ledger | 446.89ms | 322.00ms | −124.89ms |
| tx_exec | 430.07ms | 311.53ms | −118.54ms |
| commit | 8.74ms | 5.48ms | −3.26ms |
| Mismatches | — | 0 | — |

The −41% delta is larger than expected from parsing elimination alone. The baseline
binary (`6ecd777`) may have been running under different system memory pressure, or
the parsing elimination reduced GC/allocator pressure with cascading benefits.

---

### Step 5: Streamline fee_seq Processing (Expected: −5 to −10ms)

**Status**: Not started

**Problem**: The pre-apply phase (`fee_seq_us`) takes 112μs per Soroban TX (15ms/ledger).
This includes fee deduction, sequence bump, one-time signer removal, and 3 rounds of
`delta_snapshot()` + `delta_changes_between()` + `build_entry_changes_with_state_overrides()`
to track metadata changes for each sub-phase (fee, signers, seq).

**How stellar-core handles it**: `LedgerTxn` sub-transactions are O(1) push/pop. Change
tracking is implicit in the overlay stack. No explicit delta cloning.

**Solution**: For Soroban TXs (which have no per-op source accounts and typically no
PreAuthTx signers):
- Combine the three delta-tracking phases into a single phase where possible
- Skip signer removal iteration when the TX has no PreAuthTx signatures
- Use direct state mutation tracking instead of before/after snapshot diffing

**Files to modify**:
- `crates/ledger/src/execution/mod.rs` — optimize `execute_single_transaction` pre-apply

**Benchmark gate**: Expected: mean ≤ 272ms. If improvement < 3ms, investigate.

---

## Execution Protocol

For each step:

1. **Implement** the optimization
2. **Verify correctness**: `cargo test --all` + `cargo clippy --all` clean
3. **Verify parity**: `verify-execution` on ≥1000 consecutive mainnet ledgers
4. **Run benchmark**: benchmark protocol (3 runs, median of means)
5. **Evaluate**:
   - If improvement meets or exceeds the step's expected range → document results
     in the table below, commit, push, and proceed to next step
   - If improvement is below the step's minimum threshold → investigate root cause,
     attempt to fix. If fixed, re-benchmark and proceed
   - If not fixable → stop, document findings, alert human and wait for instructions

## Results

| Step | Commit | Mean | Δ from prev | Δ from baseline | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Baseline | `bd8f3f7` | 317.5ms | — | — | |
| 1: TTL key hash caching | `a1db12f` | 307.1ms | −10.4ms | −10.4ms | SHA-256 was <1μs/call |
| 2: Incremental mutation tracking | `b74e111` | 303.6ms | −3.5ms | −13.9ms | Savepoint ~2μs for Soroban (not 100-150μs) |

## Projected Results

| Step | Expected Gain | Cumulative | Ratio vs stellar-core |
|------|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| Baseline | — | 317.5ms | 1.88x |
| 1: TTL key hash caching | −10ms | 307ms | 1.82x |
| 2: Incremental mutation tracking | −3.5ms | 303.6ms | 1.80x |
| 2b: Meta construction cleanup | 0ms | 303.6ms | 1.80x |
| 3: Offer/non-offer maps | −8.83ms | ~295ms | ~1.75x |
| 4: Unified TX set parsing | ~−10ms (est.) | ~294ms | ~1.74x |
| 5: Streamline fee_seq | −5 to −10ms | 269–281ms | 1.60–1.67x |

**Projected best case: ~269ms (1.60x stellar-core)**
**Projected worst case: ~281ms (1.67x stellar-core)**

The 220ms acceptance target is not reachable with the remaining micro-optimization
steps alone. Closing the gap further would require structural changes — see
"Options for Further Optimization" below.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Sampled profiling overestimates**: The sampling profiler attributed 480μs/TX to
   "per-op bookkeeping," but targeted instrumentation showed the actual costs were
   10–100x smaller for individual operations (savepoint ~2μs, delta diff <1μs).
   The sampled cost likely included overhead from the profiler itself or unresolvable
   call-stack attribution.

2. **Entry cloning dominates meta construction**: `build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive`
   spends most of its time cloning `LedgerEntry` values into the output
   `Vec<LedgerEntryChange>`. Replacing `Vec<u8>` keys with `LedgerKey`, removing debug
   logging, and adding O(1) lookups yielded 0ms because the cloning cost dwarfs
   everything else. Fixing this requires either `Arc<LedgerEntry>` shared ownership or
   lazy/streaming meta construction.

3. **Setup/teardown is the reliable optimization target**: Per-ledger costs like
   executor_setup (10.5ms), tx_parse (7.4ms), and post_exec (7.9ms) are large, fixed,
   and have clear solutions. These are more predictable wins than per-TX micro-opts.

---

## Remaining Optimization Targets

Ranked by expected impact and confidence. Steps 1, 2, 2b, 3, and 4 are done.

### 1. Meta Construction — Arc<LedgerEntry>

**Expected gain**: −15 to −25ms | **Confidence**: Medium | **Complexity**: High

**Problem**: `build_entry_changes_with_hot_archive` costs 15-25ms/ledger, dominated
by `LedgerEntry::clone()` into `Vec<LedgerEntryChange>`. Step 2b proved that
micro-optimizations within this function don't help — the cost is fundamentally in
the cloning.

**Solution**: Replace `LedgerEntry` with `Arc<LedgerEntry>` in the state layer.
Entry changes would hold `Arc` references instead of owned clones. Mutations use
`Arc::make_mut()` for copy-on-write semantics.

**Why it's high-impact**: This is the single largest remaining per-TX cost center.
At ~130 Soroban TXs/ledger × ~150μs cloning overhead = ~20ms. Eliminating these
clones would cut the gap to stellar-core significantly.

**Risk**: Touches every state access path across `crates/tx/` and `crates/ledger/`.
Requires auditing all mutation patterns. Large blast radius but the change is
conceptually simple (replace `LedgerEntry` with `Arc<LedgerEntry>` everywhere).

### 2. Streamline fee_seq Processing (Step 5)

**Expected gain**: −5 to −10ms | **Confidence**: Medium | **Complexity**: Medium

**Problem**: Pre-apply phase takes 112μs per Soroban TX (15ms/ledger). Includes
3 rounds of `delta_snapshot()` + `delta_changes_between()` +
`build_entry_changes_with_state_overrides()` for fee/signers/seq tracking.

**Solution**: Combine the three delta-tracking phases for Soroban TXs (single op,
no PreAuthTx signers). Skip signer removal iteration when unnecessary.

### 3. Executor Setup Optimization (minor)

**Expected gain**: −2 to −5ms | **Confidence**: Medium | **Complexity**: Low

Beyond the offer/non-offer split (Step 3), executor setup includes context
creation and soroban config loading overhead. Smaller gains possible from caching
config across ledgers when it hasn't changed.

---

**Recommendation**: Re-profile with fresh instrumentation to validate whether
Arc<LedgerEntry> or fee_seq streamlining has the higher actual impact before
committing to the larger refactor. Arc<LedgerEntry> has the highest potential
gain but also the highest risk and complexity.

---

## Methodology Notes

### How the baseline was established

1. Built henyey release binary from commit `bd8f3f7` (pre-optimization main branch)
2. Ran `verify-execution --from 61349540 --to 61349640` with pre-warmed cache
3. Parsed `RUST_LOG=debug` output for per-ledger `apply_transactions` timing
4. Excluded first ledger (cold start: loads ~911K offers)
5. Computed mean/p50/p95 over remaining 136 ledgers

### How stellar-core reference was established

1. Ran stellar-core v25.2.0 (Docker `stellar/stellar-core:latest`) catchup on same
   ledger range: `catchup 61349640/101`
2. Parsed "applying ledger" → "Ledger close complete" timestamp pairs
3. Excluded first ledger, computed stats over 136 ledgers

### Linear regression methodology

Fit `time = a * classic_ops + b * soroban_ops + c` for both stellar-core and henyey.
Op counts from stellar-core's "applying ledger" log lines. Regression coefficients
decompose the gap into per-classic-op, per-soroban-op, and fixed overhead components.

### Profiling methodology (post-Step 1)

Added `std::time::Instant` instrumentation inside `execute_host_function_p25`
(encode/invoke/extract phases) and `execute_contract_invocation` (pre_checks/host/
apply/hash phases). Aggregated across ~5400 Soroban TXs on the benchmark range.
Instrumentation was temporary (reverted after data collection).
