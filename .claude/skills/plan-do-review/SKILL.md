description: Review a proposal issue with adversarial critics, converge on a plan, execute it, and iterate review-fix until clean
argument-hint: "<issue-number> [--model <model>] [--max-proposal-rounds N] [--max-review-rounds N] [--dry-run]"
---

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- The first argument is a GitHub issue number. Replace `$ISSUE` with it.
- `--model <model>`: Model for critic and review agents (default: `"gpt-5.4"`).
- `--max-proposal-rounds N`: Max proposal↔critic iterations (default: 5).
- `--max-review-rounds N`: Max implement↔review-fix iterations (default: 3).
- `--dry-run`: Run through proposal convergence only; do not execute or commit.

# Plan-Do-Review

Adversarial proposal refinement → full implementation → iterative review-fix.

This skill automates the workflow: read a GitHub issue proposal, have an
independent agent critique it, rewrite incorporating feedback, repeat until
the proposal converges, then execute the plan, have it reviewed, fix issues,
and iterate until the review is clean.

The orchestrator (you) manages state, rewrites proposals, and implements code.
All reviews and critiques are delegated to independent sub-agents so that
review is adversarial and unbiased.

---

## Guiding Principles

**Prefer long-term readable, sustainable, elegant, safe building blocks over
short-term patches — even at the cost of significant refactors.**

These principles apply at every stage of this skill — when rewriting the
proposal, when critiquing it, and when executing it:

- **Root causes over symptoms.** Address the underlying design flaw, not the
  surface manifestation. A fix that handles only the one caller that reported
  a bug is almost always the wrong answer when several callers share the same
  broken assumption.
- **Readable.** Favor code that is easy for a newcomer to read and reason
  about. Name things well. Break long functions. Let control flow mirror the
  problem domain.
- **Sustainable.** Favor designs that remain correct as the code evolves.
  Push invariants into types (newtypes, enums, const generics), constructors,
  and shared helpers so future changes cannot accidentally violate them.
- **Elegant.** Favor the minimum set of concepts that expresses the
  solution cleanly. Prefer standard Rust idioms — ownership over cloning,
  iterators over index loops, `?` over `match` chains, `Result`/`Option` over
  sentinel values.
- **Safe.** Favor designs that make incorrect states unrepresentable and
  error paths explicit. Never fail silently. Close races; don't paper over
  them with retries or sleeps.
- **Scope honestly.** If the best fix requires changing a public API,
  restructuring types, introducing `Arc`/`Cow`/lifetimes, splitting or
  merging modules, or touching several crates — propose that. The goal is
  long-term code health, not the smallest possible diff. Deferred
  refactors should be filed as follow-up issues, not papered over.
- **Parity-preserving.** In protocol/consensus/ledger code, long-term
  elegance never justifies diverging from stellar-core behavior. Match
  stellar-core semantics exactly; elegance applies to *how* we express
  those semantics in Rust.

When these principles conflict with proposal minimalism, the principles
win. A significant refactor that produces a sound, idiomatic foundation is
always preferable to a narrow patch that leaves the latent design problem
in place.

---

## Step 1: Fetch and Parse the Issue

Run:
```bash
gh issue view $ISSUE --json title,body,labels,state,comments,number
```

Extract:
- **Title**: the issue title
- **Body**: the full proposal / description
- **Comments**: any existing discussion (prior reviews, context)
- **State**: must be open (if closed, stop and report)

Read any files, crates, or stellar-core references mentioned in the issue body
to build context. You need enough understanding to critique and rewrite the
proposal intelligently.

Initialize tracking:
```
proposal_round = 0
review_round = 0
current_proposal = <issue body + any relevant context>
```

---

## Step 2: Proposal Convergence Loop

Repeat until `VERDICT: APPROVED` or `proposal_round >= max_proposal_rounds`:

### 2a: Spawn Critic Agent

Increment `proposal_round`.

Launch a background agent using the Task tool:
- **agent_type**: `"general-purpose"`
- **model**: `$MODEL`
- **name**: `"critic-round-{proposal_round}"`
- **description**: `"Critique proposal round {proposal_round}"`

The critic agent prompt must include:

```
You are an independent technical reviewer for a software proposal on the
henyey project (a Rust implementation of stellar-core). Your job is to find
gaps, incorrect assumptions, missing edge cases, scope issues, and
impractical suggestions.

## The Proposal

{current_proposal}

## Codebase Context

This is the henyey project — a Rust port of stellar-core. Key conventions:
- Determinism and stellar-core parity are non-negotiable
- Tests use Rust's built-in #[test] framework
- Code lives in crates/ (e.g., crates/tx, crates/ledger, crates/herder)
- stellar-core reference is at stellar-core/ (git submodule, pinned to v25.x)

## Your Task

Evaluate this proposal thoroughly:

1. **Correctness**: Are the technical claims accurate? Do the referenced
   code paths exist and behave as described?
2. **Completeness**: Does the proposal cover all affected code paths? Are
   there cases it misses?
3. **Feasibility**: Can this be implemented as described? Are there
   practical obstacles?
4. **Risk**: What could go wrong? What edge cases are not addressed?
5. **Scope**: Is the scope appropriate? Too broad? Too narrow?
6. **Stellar-core parity**: Will the proposed changes maintain or improve
   parity with stellar-core?
7. **Structural ambition**: Does the proposal go far enough? Could a
   bigger refactor — changing public APIs, restructuring types, using
   Arc/Cow/lifetimes, redesigning enums, splitting or merging modules —
   eliminate the *class* of bug rather than patching the one symptom?
   Prefer structural solutions that make incorrect states
   unrepresentable over minimal fixes that address one instance.
8. **Readability & sustainability**: Will the resulting code be easy to
   read, modify, and extend in six months? Does it push invariants into
   types (newtypes, enums, constructors) or shared helpers so future
   callers can't silently get it wrong? Does it use idiomatic Rust —
   ownership over cloning, iterators over index loops, `?` over match
   chains, `Result`/`Option` over sentinel values? Does it name things
   well and keep functions focused?
9. **Long-term vs. short-term tradeoff**: Is the proposed fix a durable
   building block, or a short-term patch that leaves the underlying
   design problem in place? If the latter, flag it — this skill
   explicitly prefers significant refactors that produce sound
   foundations over narrow patches that will need to be undone.

## Output Format

You MUST end your response with exactly one of these verdicts:

VERDICT: APPROVED
(if the proposal is sound and ready for implementation)

VERDICT: REVISE
(if the proposal needs changes — list specific actionable items below)

If REVISE, list each required change as a numbered item:
1. [specific actionable feedback]
2. [specific actionable feedback]
...

Be concrete. "Needs more detail" is not actionable. "Add handling for the
case where X is None at file.rs:123" is actionable.
```

### 2b: Process Critic Result

Read the agent result. Extract the verdict line.

**If `VERDICT: APPROVED`**:
- The proposal has converged. Proceed to Step 3.

**If `VERDICT: REVISE`**:
- Extract the numbered feedback items.
- Investigate each feedback item — read the relevant code, verify the
  critic's claims, determine which feedback is valid.
- Rewrite `current_proposal` incorporating valid feedback. Discard feedback
  that is incorrect (explain why in the rewrite).
- The rewrite should be a complete, self-contained proposal (not a diff).
- Loop back to 2a with the updated proposal.

**If neither verdict found** (agent error):
- Treat as `VERDICT: REVISE` with feedback "Agent did not produce a clear
  verdict — review the proposal structure and clarity."

### 2c: Post Converged Proposal

After convergence (or max rounds), post the final proposal as a GitHub issue
comment:

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE --body "$(cat <<'PROPOSAL_EOF'
## Converged Proposal (Round {proposal_round}/{max_proposal_rounds})

{current_proposal}

---

*This proposal was refined through {proposal_round} round(s) of adversarial
review using the `plan-do-review` skill.*
PROPOSAL_EOF
)"
```

If `--dry-run` is set, print the proposal to stdout instead of posting and
**stop here**.

---

## Step 3: Execute the Proposal

Implement the converged proposal in full. This is the core implementation
phase — you (the orchestrator) do the actual coding work.

**Apply the Guiding Principles above.** Implement the proposal as a
durable building block, not a short-term patch. If carrying out the
proposal reveals that a larger refactor — changing public API
signatures, restructuring types, introducing Arc/Cow/lifetimes,
redesigning enums, splitting modules, or touching several crates —
would produce a significantly more readable, sustainable, elegant, or
safe result, do the refactor rather than working around it. File any
intentionally-deferred refactors as follow-up issues so they aren't
lost; don't paper them over with inline workarounds.

### 3a: Plan the Implementation

Break the proposal into concrete implementation steps. Use SQL todos for
tracking:

```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description, status) VALUES
  ('step-1', '...', '...', 'pending'),
  ('step-2', '...', '...', 'pending');
INSERT INTO todo_deps (todo_id, depends_on) VALUES ('step-2', 'step-1');
```

### 3b: Implement

For each step:
1. Update the todo to `in_progress`
2. Make the code changes
3. Run `cargo check --all` after each logical change
4. Run focused tests: `cargo test -p <crate>`
5. Update the todo to `done`

### 3c: Verify

After all steps are complete:
1. `cargo test --all` — full test suite passes
2. `cargo clippy --all` — no warnings
3. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — formatting clean

Fix any issues before proceeding.

### 3d: Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<short imperative description>

<longer description of what was implemented>

Closes #$ISSUE

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"

git push
```

If push is rejected, `git pull --rebase && git push`.

---

## Step 4: Review-Fix Loop

Repeat until `VERDICT: SOUND` or `review_round >= max_review_rounds`:

### 4a: Spawn Review-Fix Agent

Increment `review_round`.

Get the commit hash:
```bash
git log -1 --format='%H'
```

Launch a background agent using the Task tool:
- **agent_type**: `"general-purpose"`
- **model**: `$MODEL`
- **name**: `"review-fix-round-{review_round}"`
- **description**: `"Review-fix round {review_round}"`

The review-fix agent prompt must include the full review-fix skill protocol.
Read the review-fix skill template to assemble the prompt:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/review-fix/SKILL.md
```

Substitute `$COMMIT` with the actual commit hash and set `$MODE = review`.

Prepend context about what was implemented:
```
You are reviewing commit {commit_hash} in the current repository.
This commit implements the proposal from GitHub issue #{issue_number}.

{brief summary of what was implemented}

Follow the review-fix skill instructions below exactly. Mode is review
(do NOT make changes). Produce the full structured report.

{contents of .claude/skills/review-fix/SKILL.md}
```

### 4b: Process Review Result

Read the agent result. Extract the verdict from the Fix Analysis section.

**If `SOUND`**:
- The implementation is clean. Proceed to Step 5.

**If `CONCERNS`, `INCOMPLETE`, or `WRONG`**:
- Extract every specific issue from the review report:
  - Missing per-op checks
  - Untested code paths
  - Similar issues found
  - Architectural gaps
  - Parity issues
  - Fundamental design issues
- **Address every single issue.** Do not skip, defer, or dismiss any feedback.
  Read the relevant code to understand each issue, then fix it. If a reviewer
  raised it, it gets fixed — period.
- For each issue:
  1. Read the relevant code to understand the problem
  2. Make the code changes to fully resolve it
  3. Add or update tests to cover the fix
  4. Run `cargo test --all` and `cargo clippy --all`
- Once all issues are resolved, commit with a descriptive message, push, and
  loop back to 4a.
- If `WRONG`, consider whether a revert and re-implementation is cleaner than
  incremental fixes. Either way, all feedback must be addressed before the
  next review round.

**If verdict unclear** (agent error):
- Treat as `CONCERNS` and extract all actionable items from the agent output.
  Address every item — do not skip any.

---

## Step 5: Completion

Post a completion comment on the GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE --body "$(cat <<'DONE_EOF'
## Implementation Complete

Implemented in commit(s):
{list of commit hashes with one-line descriptions}

### Summary
{brief description of what was implemented}

### Review Status
Passed review-fix in {review_round} round(s).
Final verdict: **SOUND**

### What was done
{bullet list of changes}

### What was deferred (if any)
{bullet list of follow-up items}

---

*Implemented and reviewed using the `plan-do-review` skill.*

Print a summary to the terminal:

## Guidelines

- **The orchestrator implements; agents review.** You write code and make
  changes. Sub-agents only analyze and critique. This separation ensures
  reviews are independent.
- **Post everything to the issue.** The GitHub issue is the audit trail.
  Every proposal revision and review result should be visible there.
- **Respect max rounds.** If proposal convergence or review-fix hits the max,
  post whatever you have and note the remaining concerns. Do not loop forever.
- **Be honest about feedback.** If a critic's feedback is wrong, explain why
  in the rewrite. If it is right, fix it. Do not ignore valid feedback.
- **Address all review-fix feedback.** Every issue raised in a review-fix
  round must be fully resolved before the next round. No feedback may be
  skipped, deferred, or dismissed. If the reviewer raised it, fix it.
- **Use the codebase, not assumptions.** Before rewriting a proposal or
  implementing code, read the actual files. Do not rely on memory or the
  issue description alone.
- **One commit per review round.** Each review-fix iteration should produce
  one commit addressing all feedback from that round.
- **Parity is non-negotiable.** For any change touching protocol, consensus,
  or ledger logic, verify against stellar-core.
