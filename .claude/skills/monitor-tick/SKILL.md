# Monitor Tick

One invocation of the monitor loop. Intended to be called on a ~10-minute
cadence by an external orchestrator (crontab, systemd timer, CI) via
`claude -p '/monitor-tick'`, or by a Claude-internal `/loop 10m /monitor-tick`.

## Preconditions

This skill expects `/home/tomer/data/monitor-loop.env` to exist — it is
written by `/monitor-loop` at startup and contains the runtime config.
If the file is missing, **bail out immediately** with:

```
ERROR: /home/tomer/data/monitor-loop.env not found — run /monitor-loop first.
```

Load the env file at the start of the tick:

```bash
set -a
source /home/tomer/data/monitor-loop.env
set +a
```

Variables provided by the env file (all required):

- `MONITOR_SESSION_ID` — 8-char session id, e.g. `74535976`
- `MONITOR_MODE` — `validator` or `watcher`
- `MONITOR_CONFIG` — path to the TOML config, e.g. `configs/validator-mainnet-rpc.toml`
- `MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT` — `11627` (validator) or `11727` (watcher)
- `MONITOR_RPC_PORT` — `8000` (validator) or empty (watcher)
- `MONITOR_RUN_FLAGS` — `--validator` (validator) or empty (watcher)

Throughout this skill, substitute those values for the `$MONITOR_*` references below.

## Fresh-start state

Determine once at the top of the tick: if `/home/tomer/data/mainnet/mainnet.db`
does NOT exist, set `FRESH_START=yes` (sync deadline = 4h). Otherwise
`FRESH_START=no` (sync deadline = 15m). Use this when evaluating check (2).

## Crash-recovery state

If the node's previous run ended with a crash or wedge (SIGKILL), restart
begins from a stale lcl that can be hours behind mainnet tip; replay will
legitimately exceed the 15m clean-restart deadline.

Detect crash-recovery once at the top of the tick. The rule fires on
**either** of these signals (both gated by `uptime < 2h`, after which
recovery is considered complete regardless):

1. **Rotation signal**: the most recent log rotation in the session's
   `logs/` dir is a `.crashed-*`, `.stuck-*`, or `.frozen-*` (not a
   planned `.preredeploy-*`). Uses `find` (not shell globs) to avoid
   zsh `NO_NOMATCH` failing the pipeline. Anchors to "most recent
   rotation type" rather than a narrow timing window — the old 60s
   window missed the rebuild-then-restart workflow where minutes
   elapse between log rotation and process start.

2. **Active-catchup signal** (fires even when the rotation was
   `.preredeploy-*`): the node is in `Catching Up` state AND uptime
   exceeds 5 minutes. Normal clean-restart catchup (a few ledgers
   missed during a build) finishes within 2-3 minutes. If the node is
   still catching up past 5 minutes, the persisted lcl is more than a
   few-minutes stale — which is the condition the extended deadline is
   meant for. This handles the case where a manual planned restart
   (which rotates as `preredeploy-*`) happens AFTER a wedge, leaving
   the lcl hours stale.

```bash
CRASH_RECOVERY=no
PID=$(pgrep -f 'henyey.*run' | head -1)
if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
  uptime_sec=$(ps -o etimes= -p "$PID" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ')
  uptime_sec=${uptime_sec:-0}
  if [ "$uptime_sec" -lt 7200 ]; then
    # Signal 1: newest rotation type
    logs_dir="/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs"
    newest_rotation=$(find "$logs_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
        \( -name 'monitor.log.crashed-*' \
        -o -name 'monitor.log.stuck-*' \
        -o -name 'monitor.log.frozen-*' \
        -o -name 'monitor.log.preredeploy-*' \) \
      -printf '%T@ %p\n' 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
    case "$newest_rotation" in
      *.crashed-*|*.stuck-*|*.frozen-*) CRASH_RECOVERY=yes ;;
    esac

    # Signal 2: active catchup past the clean-restart window
    if [ "$CRASH_RECOVERY" = "no" ] && [ "$uptime_sec" -gt 300 ]; then
      node_state=$(curl -s -m 3 "http://localhost:$MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT/info" 2>/dev/null \
                   | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get("state",""))' 2>/dev/null)
      if [ "$node_state" = "Catching Up" ]; then
        CRASH_RECOVERY=yes
      fi
    fi
  fi
fi
```

When `CRASH_RECOVERY=yes` and `FRESH_START=no`, extend the sync deadline to
60m and qualify the SYNC FAILURE check with a progress signal: if lcl has
advanced by ≥ 500 ledgers since the previous tick's tracker, the node is
replaying, not stuck — report CATCHING UP. Flag SYNC FAILURE only when
lcl has NOT advanced OR the 60m extended deadline is exceeded.

Clean-restart cases (no crash rotation matched) keep the 15m deadline.

## Health checks

**(1) Log scan** — `tail -n 500 /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log`.
Scan for hash mismatches ("hash mismatch", "HashMismatch", differing expected/actual
hashes), panics/crashes ("panic", "thread.*panicked", "SIGABRT", "SIGSEGV"),
ERROR-level log lines, assertion failures ("assertion failed").

**(2) Ledger progression & sync deadline** — persist ledger progression across
ticks so STUCK can be detected by a single invocation:

- Read `/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/last_ledger` (if it exists) —
  format is `"<ledger>|<unix-timestamp>"`.
- Extract the current ledger from the most recent Heartbeat line in the log tail.
- If the file exists and its ledger equals the current ledger and the recorded
  timestamp is more than 600s old, flag STUCK.
- If the ledger has advanced or the file is missing, overwrite
  `/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/last_ledger` with `"<current-ledger>|<now>"`.
- Check node uptime: `ps -o etime= -p $(pgrep -f 'henyey.*run' | head -1)`.
  Active deadline: **15m** when `FRESH_START=no` and `CRASH_RECOVERY=no`,
  **60m** when `CRASH_RECOVERY=yes`, **4h** when `FRESH_START=yes`.
- If uptime exceeds the active deadline and the node is not yet in real-time sync:
  check the latest Heartbeat for the gap between `ledger` and `latest_ext` —
  if gap > 5, or if RPC status is `unhealthy` (i.e. `age` > 30s), or if
  `heard_from_quorum=false`, flag SYNC FAILURE.
- **Progress carveout (only when `CRASH_RECOVERY=yes`)**: if lcl has advanced
  by ≥ 500 ledgers since the previous tick's `last_ledger`, the node is
  actively replaying — report CATCHING UP (no SYNC FAILURE) regardless of
  uptime. When lcl stops advancing AND uptime exceeds 60m, flag SYNC FAILURE.

**"Real-time sync" means `age < 30s`, NOT just Heartbeat gap=0** — gap is the
node's local view (`latest_ext - ledger`) and stays at 0 even when the node is
minutes behind the network if it hasn't received those externalization messages
yet. The authoritative wall-clock signal is RPC `age`. If `age` is persistently
> 30s for a non-fresh-start node past the 15m deadline, the node is lagging
network tip; treat as SYNC FAILURE even with gap=0 and heard_from_quorum=true.
Do NOT report this as a WARNING and wait. Investigate the catchup path: check
for checkpoint-boundary stalls ("failed to download header"), hash mismatches,
or event loop freezes in the log. If `FRESH_START=yes` and uptime is under 4h,
a large gap is expected — report CATCHING UP instead of SYNC FAILURE.

**(3) Process alive** — `pgrep -af 'henyey.*run'`. If not running, before relaunching:

1. `rm -f /home/tomer/data/mainnet/mainnet.lock` to clear any stale lockfile.
2. Preserve the prior session's log:
   `mv /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log.crashed-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) 2>/dev/null || true`
3. Relaunch with append redirection so interleaving restart pathways don't nuke history:
   ```
   RUST_LOG=info nohup /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/cargo-target/release/henyey \
     --mainnet run $MONITOR_RUN_FLAGS -c $MONITOR_CONFIG \
     >> /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log 2>&1 &
   ```

**(3b) Wedge detection** — a process can be alive but have a frozen event
loop (watchdog fires, HTTP hangs, ledger progression stops). Check 3 alone
misses this because `pgrep` still finds the PID. Detect and remediate:

1. Is the event loop frozen? `grep 'WATCHDOG: Event loop appears frozen'
   $LOG | tail -1` — if present AND its timestamp is within the last 120s,
   the watchdog is currently firing.
2. Is HTTP hung? `curl -s -m 3 http://localhost:$MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT/info`
   returns empty body or times out.

If BOTH hold, flag WEDGE and execute the kill+relaunch path, rotating the
log as `.frozen-<ts>` (NOT `.crashed-<ts>`) so the next tick's crash-
recovery signal 1 matches:

```bash
PID=$(pgrep -f 'henyey.*run' | head -1)
kill "$PID"; for i in $(seq 1 10); do sleep 1; kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null || break; done
kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null && kill -9 "$PID" && sleep 2
rm -f /home/tomer/data/mainnet/mainnet.lock
mv /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log \
   /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log.frozen-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) 2>/dev/null || true
RUST_LOG=info nohup /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/cargo-target/release/henyey \
  --mainnet run $MONITOR_RUN_FLAGS -c $MONITOR_CONFIG \
  >> /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log 2>&1 &
```

Wedges are a known recurring symptom (see #1904, #1873, #1921). Always
file a new `ready` issue referencing the most recent related one —
recurrence-after-fix → NEW issue, not a comment on a closed one.

**(4) Memory** — `ps -o rss= -p $(pgrep -f 'henyey.*run' | head -1)`, convert to MB.

- If `RSS > 12 GB`, flag HIGH MEMORY (report-only; no restart).
- **Restart condition** (restart only if ALL of the following hold):
  1. `RSS > 16 GB`, AND
  2. system `available` memory (from `free -m`) `< 8 GB`, AND
  3. latest two `Memory report summary` entries both show `heap_components_mb`
     above the earlier snapshot by > 500 MB (i.e. heap is actively growing,
     not just file cache or transient replay state).
- Restart procedure: `kill <PID>`, wait 10s, `kill -9` if still alive, then
  relaunch as in check 3.

Rationale: the old rule (`RSS > 16 GB OR available < 4 GB`) fired on legitimate
catchup transients (large file_rss from bucket reads, transient unaccounted
jemalloc state) and restarting during catchup discards replay progress and
makes recovery worse. The tightened condition gates on (a) memory pressure
at the system level, AND (b) evidence of a real heap leak, so the safety net
fires only when needed. Use the `available` column — NOT `free` — to avoid
false positives from reclaimable kernel cache.

**(5) Disk** — `df -h /home/tomer/data | tail -1`. If usage > 85%, flag LOW DISK.
Then clean up old rotated log archives (keep 3 most recent per category):

```bash
if test -d /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs; then
  logs_dir=/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs
  for pat in preredeploy crashed stuck frozen; do
    find "$logs_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "monitor.log.$pat-*" \
      -printf '%f\n' 2>/dev/null \
      | sort -r | tail -n +4 \
      | while read -r f; do rm -f "$logs_dir/$f"; done
  done
fi
```

Uses `find -printf` (not shell glob) to avoid zsh `NO_NOMATCH` aborting the
pipeline when a category has no files — the earlier `ls glob | tail` form
printed `no matches found` and silently skipped cleanup for the remaining
categories. The ISO 8601 timestamp suffix sorts lexicographically, so
`sort -r` gives newest-first; `tail -n +4` skips the 3 newest and emits
the rest for deletion. Includes `frozen` so wedge-rotations are also
capped at 3 retained. Report how many files were removed if any.

**(6) Session disk** — `du -sh /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/`
and `du -sh /home/tomer/data/mainnet/`. If combined > 200 GB, flag SESSION DISK HIGH.

**(7) Memory report** — `grep 'Memory report summary' /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/logs/monitor.log | tail -1`.
If grep returns no output AND process uptime > 400s, flag WARNING
memory-report-missing (log format may have changed). Memory reports emit
every ~6 minutes, so an uptime below 400s legitimately has no entry yet on
a post-restart tick — report `memreport: N/A (warmup)` and move on.
Otherwise extract `jemalloc_allocated_mb`, `jemalloc_resident_mb`,
`fragmentation_pct`, `heap_components_mb`, `mmap_mb`, `unaccounted_mb`,
`unaccounted_sign`. If `fragmentation_pct > 50`, flag HIGH FRAGMENTATION.
If `unaccounted_mb > 1000` with sign `+`, note it (known jemalloc overhead,
not a bug — but verify `heap_components` is stable; if it is growing, investigate).

**(8) RPC health** (validator mode only — skip in watcher mode) —
`curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$MONITOR_RPC_PORT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}'`.
Verify response is non-empty and `status` is `healthy`. Check pruning:
`latestLedger - oldestLedger` should be ≤ `retention_window + 250` (allows
one full maintenance cycle's worth of new ledgers — maintenance every 900s ≈
180 ledgers at 5s/ledger, +70 headroom). If gap > `retention_window + 500`,
flag PRUNING STALLED. If RPC is not responding, flag RPC DOWN.

**(9) OBSRVR Radar** (validator mode only — skip in watcher mode) — get
public key from `curl -s http://localhost:$MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT/info`
(extract `public_key`). Then `curl -s https://radar.withobsrvr.com/api/v1/nodes/<PUBLIC_KEY>`.
Check:
- `isValidating` — if false and node running > 30 min, flag NOT VALIDATING.
- `validating24HoursPercentage` — if < 50 and running > 6 hours, flag LOW VALIDATION RATE.
- `lag` — if > 500, flag HIGH LAG.

If the API errors out, emit `obsrvr: N/A (api-error)` instead of omitting the field.

If the API returns a response but `latestLedger` or `updatedAt` is missing/null
(partial response), treat the entire radar result as stale / incomplete and
emit `obsrvr: N/A (api-incomplete)`. Do NOT evaluate `lag` in this case — a
`lag` value returned alongside a null `latestLedger`/`updatedAt` is a cached
aggregate from a prior observation window (observed post-restart: lag=8754
against a node that is in real-time sync with age=2s).

**(12) Metrics scan** — scrape `/metrics` and evaluate the alert catalog.

1. `mkdir -p /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics`.
2. `mv /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/current.prom /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/prev.prom 2>/dev/null || true`.
3. `curl -s http://localhost:$MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT/metrics > /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/current.prom`.
4. Restart detection: for any counter, if `current < prev`, treat delta as
   `current` (node restarted this tick or last tick). For the first 2 ticks
   after a detected restart (from check 3 or check 10, or `CRASH_RECOVERY=yes`),
   skip the following alerts (warmup allowance — overlay handshake + jemalloc
   arena stabilization + from-zero counters take ~10 minutes to settle):
   - `henyey_jemalloc_fragmentation_pct > 50` (post-restart fragmentation
     ramps from ~35-45% and settles to ~18% within 2 ticks)
   - `stellar_peer_count < 8` (authenticated peer count ramps from 0 → 5 → 10+
     over the first 10 minutes as overlay handshakes complete)
   - counter-started-at-zero delta alerts

### Metric alert catalog

**COUNTERS** (fire on `delta ≥ threshold`):

- `stellar_herder_lost_sync_total` ≥1 → SYNC
- `henyey_post_catchup_hard_reset_total` ≥1 → ACTION
- `delta(henyey_recovery_stalled_tick_total{reason="forcing_catchup_behind"})` ≥1 → WARN
  - **Labeled counter** — uses Form 2 extraction (single labeled series; see §Metric extraction forms).
  - Only alerts on `forcing_catchup_behind` — the node is behind consensus AND the recovery loop timed out and forced a catchup.
  - Excludes `backoff_active` (informational, increments routinely on every 10s tick during 60s backoff windows).
  - Excludes `forcing_catchup_not_behind` (demoted to debug; the fast-track caller emits its own WARN before entering this path, so double-alerting adds noise).
  - **Alert identity**: use the selector-qualified name `henyey_recovery_stalled_tick_total{reason="forcing_catchup_behind"}` in cooldown keys, issue-search/title keys, and status text.
- `(stellar_overlay_timeout_idle_total + stellar_overlay_timeout_straggler_total)` ≥5× prior-tick-sum → WARN
- `(stellar_overlay_error_read_total + stellar_overlay_error_write_total)` ≥50 → WARN
- `henyey_archive_cache_refresh_error_total` ≥1 → NONC
- `henyey_archive_cache_refresh_timeout_total` ≥3 → NONC

`stellar_ledger_apply_failure_total`, `henyey_scp_post_verify_drops_total`, and
`stellar_herder_pending_too_old_total` are
**no longer checked as absolute-delta counters** — they are covered by the ratio
checks below, which are traffic-proportional and self-calibrating.

**GAUGES** (fire on absolute threshold against current snapshot):

- `stellar_peer_count` <8 → WARN
- `henyey_jemalloc_fragmentation_pct` >50 on two consecutive ticks → WARN
- `stellar_ledger_age_current_seconds` >30 when uptime >15m AND `CRASH_RECOVERY=no` AND `FRESH_START=no` → SYNC (during `CRASH_RECOVERY=yes` age is legitimately large while replay catches up; during clean post-restart bucket-apply / short-gap replay age is also legitimately large until catchup completes. The authoritative sync check is (2), with its deadline and progress carveout — this gauge is a secondary signal gated to the same 15m window as `stellar_herder_state`)
- `stellar_herder_state` !=2 when uptime >15m AND `CRASH_RECOVERY=no` AND `FRESH_START=no` → SYNC (during crash-recovery the node is legitimately in state=1 Catching Up until replay completes)
- `henyey_scp_verify_input_backlog` >100 → WARN
- `henyey_scp_verifier_thread_state` !=0 → WARN (0=Running, 1=Stopping, 2=Dead)
- `stellar_herder_pending_envelopes` >2000 → WARN
- `henyey_overlay_fetch_channel_depth_max` >500 → WARN
- `(henyey_process_open_fds / henyey_process_max_fds)` >0.85 → WARN
- `henyey_herder_drift_max_seconds` >10 → NONC

`quorum_agree` / `quorum_missing` / `quorum_fail_at` are intentionally NOT
monitored — they snapshot the tracking slot's QuorumInfo and return
false-positive noise between externalizations; see `monitor-loop/SKILL.md`
Metrics Scan section for the code-path explanation.

**HISTOGRAMS** (fire on p99 bucket of per-tick delta): for each histogram H,

```
bucket_delta[le] = H_bucket_current[le] - H_bucket_prev[le]
count_delta = H_count_current - H_count_prev
```

Skip if `count_delta < 20`. Compute cumulative bucket delta at upper edge L:
`sum(bucket_delta[le] for le ≤ L)`. The smallest L where cumulative ≥
`0.99 * count_delta` is the p99 upper bound.

Thresholds (all WARN):

- `henyey_ledger_close_handle_complete_seconds` p99 >0.5s
- `henyey_ledger_close_dispatch_to_join_seconds` p99 >5s
- `henyey_ledger_close_post_complete_seconds` p99 >0.5s
- `henyey_ledger_close_tx_exec_seconds` p99 >1s
- `henyey_ledger_close_soroban_exec_seconds` p99 >1s
- `henyey_ledger_close_commit_seconds` p99 >0.5s
- `henyey_ledger_close_soroban_state_seconds` p99 >0.5s
- `henyey_ledger_close_complete_tx_queue_seconds` p99 >0.5s

Mean check (`sum_delta / count_delta`) is a cheaper fallback — fire on whichever breaches.

### Metric extraction forms

Counter catalog entries use one of three extraction forms. When adding a new
counter, check the emission site in `crates/app/src/metrics.rs` to determine
whether the metric is scalar or labeled, and use the appropriate form.

**Form 1 — Scalar counter** (most counters):
```bash
cur=$(grep -E '^<metric_name> ' current.prom | awk '{printf "%d", $2}')
prev=$(grep -E '^<metric_name> ' prev.prom | awk '{printf "%d", $2}')
```

**Form 2 — Single labeled series** (extract one specific label value):
```bash
cur=$(grep -E '^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value>"\} ' current.prom | awk '{printf "%d", $2}')
prev=$(grep -E '^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value>"\} ' prev.prom | awk '{printf "%d", $2}')
```

**Form 3 — Sum of explicit labeled series** (sum specific label values):
```bash
cur=$(awk '/^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value1>"\}|^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value2>"\}/ {sum+=$NF} END{printf "%d", sum+0}' current.prom)
prev=$(awk '/^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value1>"\}|^<metric_name>\{<label>="<value2>"\}/ {sum+=$NF} END{printf "%d", sum+0}' prev.prom)
```

For all forms, delta handling is identical:
- Extract `prev` using the same pattern against `prev.prom` (default 0 if absent)
- If `current < prev`: counter reset (node restarted) → `delta = current`
- Otherwise: `delta = current - prev`

**Label-presence validation:** For labeled counters, validate that the
expected label set is present before extracting. This catches silent
renames or removals that would weaken an alert. If the expected label set
is missing or mutated, **skip the alert entirely** rather than treating
missing series as zero. Follow the existing pattern used for
`henyey_scp_post_verify_total` (lines 406-413):
```bash
labels=$(grep -oP '^<metric_name>\{<label>="\K[^"]+' current.prom | sort)
expected=$(printf '%s\n' <label1> <label2> ... | sort)
if [ "$labels" != "$expected" ]; then
  # report: <metric>: skipped (label set mismatch)
fi
```

### Ratio checks — sustained breach detection

Three ratio-based checks replace the former absolute-delta thresholds for
`stellar_ledger_apply_failure_total`, `henyey_scp_post_verify_drops_total`,
and `stellar_herder_pending_too_old_total`.
These fire only after **3 consecutive ticks** of threshold breach, avoiding
transient spikes.

**Required inputs** — global (all must be present, non-empty, numeric; if any
missing or invalid, skip ratio checks entirely, empty the ratio snapshot,
reset streaks):

1. `stellar_ledger_age_current_seconds` — sync gating
2. `stellar_ledger_apply_success_total`
3. `stellar_ledger_apply_failure_total`
4. `henyey_scp_post_verify_total{reason="accepted"}`
5. `henyey_scp_post_verify_total{reason="processed_directly"}`
6. Sum of all 13 `henyey_scp_post_verify_total{reason="..."}` lines (`pv_total_sum`)

**Per-check required inputs** — these are NOT part of the global required set.
If missing, only the pending check (Check 3) skips; SCP and apply proceed
normally:

7. `stellar_herder_pending_too_old_total`
8. `stellar_herder_pending_received_total`

**Post-verify label-set validation:** After extracting the 13
`henyey_scp_post_verify_total{reason="..."}` lines, validate that the exact set
of reason labels is: `invalid_sig`, `panic`, `drift_range`, `drift_close_time`,
`drift_cannot_receive`, `self_message`, `non_quorum`, `buffered`, `duplicate`,
`too_far`, `buffer_full`, `processed_directly`, `accepted`. If any label is
missing or unexpected labels appear, treat as missing counters (partial scrape
or label change).

**Skip conditions** (skip all ratio checks when any is true):
- `FRESH_START=yes`
- Heartbeat gap > 5
- `stellar_ledger_age_current_seconds > 30`
- Process uptime < 10 minutes
- `/metrics` fetch fails (curl error or empty response)
- `/metrics` returns "recorder not installed"
- Any required counter missing or invalid
- Post-verify label set ≠ expected 13 labels

On any skip: **empty** `/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/ratio_snapshot`,
reset all streak counters to 0, report `metrics_ratio: skipped (<reason>)`.

**Snapshot file:** `/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/ratio_snapshot`

Format:
```
version=1
pid=<PID>
start_ticks=<field 22 from /proc/$PID/stat>
timestamp=<ISO8601>
apply_success=<value>
apply_failure=<value>
pv_accepted=<value>
pv_processed_directly=<value>
pv_total_sum=<value>
apply_breach_streak=<N>
scp_breach_streak=<N>
pending_too_old=<value>
pending_received=<value>
pending_breach_streak=<N>
```

**Process identity:** `start_ticks` = field 22 from `/proc/$PID/stat` (starttime
in clock ticks since boot). Extract with `awk '{print $22}' /proc/$PID/stat`.
Locale-independent, catches PID reuse.

**Invalidation:**
- PID or `start_ticks` changed → discard, write new baseline, reset streaks
- Snapshot malformed, missing fields, or `version` ≠ `1` → discard
- Any current counter < previous value → discard (counter reset)

**Metric extraction** — illustrative pseudocode (not literal shell; each bail
point must stop ratio-check processing for this tick):

```bash
metrics_body=$(curl -s http://localhost:$MONITOR_ADMIN_PORT/metrics)

# Bail on fetch failure — stop ratio checks for this tick
if [ -z "$metrics_body" ]; then
  > /home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/ratio_snapshot
  # report: metrics_ratio: skipped (fetch failed)
  # STOP — do not proceed to extraction or ratio evaluation
fi

```

**Check 1: SCP post-verify acceptance rate**
- Numerator delta: `delta(pv_accepted) + delta(pv_processed)`
- Denominator delta: `delta(pv_total_sum)`
- Alert: `(numerator / denominator) < 0.05` (less than 5% accepted) for 3 consecutive ticks
- Min denominator delta: 500 (below → `scp: skipped (low volume)`, reset scp streak)
- Baseline acceptance on mainnet: ~10-20%. <5% sustained = nearly nothing reaching SCP.
- On breach: increment `scp_breach_streak`. If streak ≥ 3, route through Bug Filing Workflow
  (investigate verifier thread, stale envelopes, sync state).
- **On healthy tick** (ratio ≥ 0.05 with sufficient volume): reset `scp_breach_streak` to 0.

**Check 2: Transaction apply failure rate**
- Numerator delta: `delta(apply_failure)`
- Denominator delta: `delta(apply_failure) + delta(apply_success)`
- Alert: `(numerator / denominator) > 0.50` (over 50% fail) for 3 consecutive ticks
- Min denominator delta: 200 (below → `apply: skipped (low volume)`, reset apply streak)
- On breach: increment `apply_breach_streak`. If streak ≥ 3, investigate in same tick.
  If evidence points to henyey apply-engine bug, file/comment via Bug Filing Workflow.
  If expected bad-tx traffic (spam wave, known rejections), report as WARNING without filing.
- **On healthy tick** (ratio ≤ 0.50 with sufficient volume): reset `apply_breach_streak` to 0.

**Check 3: Pending too-old rate**
- Numerator delta: `delta(pending_too_old)`
- Denominator delta: `delta(pending_received)`
- Alert: `(numerator / denominator) > 0.50` (over 50% too old) for 3 consecutive ticks
- Min denominator delta: 100 (below → `pending: skipped (low volume)`, reset pending streak)
- **Per-check skip:** If `pending_counters_valid` is false (missing counters), skip this check
  only — report `pending: skipped (missing counters)`, reset `pending_breach_streak` to 0.
  SCP and apply checks proceed normally.
- On breach: increment `pending_breach_streak`. If streak ≥ 3, report as WARNING
  (overlay lag or stale-envelope flood). Investigate overlay peer health and slot progression.
- **On healthy tick** (ratio ≤ 0.50 with sufficient volume): reset `pending_breach_streak` to 0.

**Per-check state machine** (each check independently):
- **Skip** (global skip, low volume, or missing data) → reset that check's streak to 0
- **Healthy** (ratio within threshold, sufficient volume) → reset streak to 0
- **Breach** (ratio exceeds threshold, sufficient volume) → increment streak

**Per-check low-volume:** When only one check's denominator delta is below its
minimum, that check skips (streak resets to 0) and the others proceed normally.

**Thresholds are provisional** — tune after 1-2 weeks of production data.

**Status report:** Each check independently reports one of: `ok (value)`,
`skipped (reason)`, `WARNING value (N ticks)`, or `collecting baseline`.

**Rendering precedence** (determines the `metrics_ratio:` line format):

1. **Global skip** (all checks skipped for the same reason — e.g., not in sync,
   fetch failed, recorder not installed, missing counters, label mismatch):
   Use the collapsed form: `metrics_ratio: skipped (<reason>)`
2. **Collecting baseline** (no previous snapshot exists — first steady-state tick):
   `metrics_ratio: collecting baseline`
3. **Per-check reporting** (at least one check ran — whether ok, warning, or
   individually skipped for low volume or missing per-check inputs):
   Compose: `metrics_ratio: scp <scp_status>, apply <apply_status>, pending <pending_status>`

Examples:
- All healthy: `metrics_ratio: scp ok (accept=15%), apply ok (fail=8%), pending ok (too_old=3%)`
- One warning: `metrics_ratio: scp ok (accept=12%), apply WARNING fail=55%>50% (3 ticks) — investigating, pending ok (too_old=5%)`
- One skipped (low volume): `metrics_ratio: scp skipped (low volume), apply ok (fail=5%), pending ok (too_old=2%)`
- Pending skipped (missing counters): `metrics_ratio: scp ok (accept=15%), apply ok (fail=8%), pending skipped (missing counters)`
- Global skip: `metrics_ratio: skipped (not in sync)`
- Collecting: `metrics_ratio: collecting baseline`

### Firing alerts — cooldown + filing

For each firing alert:

1. Read `/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/metrics/anomaly_cooldown.json`
   (create empty `{}` if missing).
2. If `now - last_filed[<metric>] < 7200s` (2h), include the alert in the
   status report but SKIP file/comment.
3. Otherwise follow the BUG FILING WORKFLOW:
   - Search `gh issue list --search "metrics: <metric-name>" --state open`.
   - If one matches, `gh issue comment <N>` with the new evidence (current/prev
     values, delta, threshold, ledger, binary sha, sibling metrics) and ensure
     `ready` label is set.
   - If no match, `gh issue create --label ready` with:
     - Title: `Non-critical: metrics: <metric>` (NONC tier) or `metrics: <metric> — <symptom>` (WARN/SYNC tier).
     - Body: current/prev values, delta, threshold, ledger, binary sha, related
       sibling metrics, file:line citation from `grep -n "<metric_name_without_prefix>" crates/ -r`,
       and a suggested fix.
4. Update `anomaly_cooldown.json` with `{"<metric>": <now>}`.
5. For SYNC-tier alerts, ALSO update the `sync:` line in the status report
   (not just `metrics:`).

### Watcher mode

If `$MONITOR_MODE = watcher`, run check (12) with a reduced catalog: only
process (open_fds, max_fds), jemalloc, and overlay counters/gauges. Skip
SCP, quorum, herder_state, histogram p99 alerts, and ratio checks.

## Remote sync & redeploy

**(10) Remote sync** — first sanity-check the working tree:

- If `git status --porcelain` reports any output, ABORT the deploy path for
  this tick. Report: `DEPLOY SKIPPED (dirty tree)` with the list of dirty
  paths. Do not run `git pull` against a dirty tree; do not kill the node.
  Investigate the dirty tree before the next tick.
- If clean, `git fetch origin main`. If in detached HEAD state
  (`git symbolic-ref HEAD` fails), `git checkout main` first.
- Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` vs `git rev-parse origin/main`.

If they differ (origin/main is ahead):

1. Check CI status on origin/main: `gh run list --branch main --limit 3 --json conclusion --jq '.[].conclusion'`.
   If any recent run has conclusion `failure`, do NOT deploy — route the failure
   through check (11) and wait.
2. If all conclusions are `success` (ignore `""` for in-progress and `cancelled`):
   `git pull --rebase`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/tomer/data/$MONITOR_SESSION_ID/cargo-target cargo build --release -p henyey`.
3. If build succeeds: preserve the log, then kill the node (`kill <PID>`,
   wait 10s, `kill -9` if still alive), restart with the launch command from
   check (3) (append redirection), report:
   `DEPLOY — pulled <N> commits (<old-sha>..<new-sha>), rebuilt, restarted at L<ledger>`.
4. If build fails: report `BUILD FAILED`, do NOT restart — the old binary is
   still running. Route the build error through check (11).

If `HEAD == origin/main`: no action (already up to date).

## CI check workflow

**(11) CI check** — scope and levels of detection.

**(11a) Scope**: only inspect workflows that run on branch main.
`gh run list --branch main --limit 10 --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion,headSha,createdAt --jq '.[] | "\(.name)|\(.status)|\(.conclusion)|\(.headSha[:8])|\(.databaseId)|\(.createdAt)"'`.
Ignore runs triggered by PRs on other branches. Scan for completed runs with
conclusion `failure`.

**(11b) Job-level** (CRITICAL — catches continue-on-error failures): For the
latest completed run of EACH distinct workflow name (enumerate dynamically
from 11a, do NOT hard-code names), check individual jobs:
`gh run view <ID> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion == "failure") | "\(.name)|\(.conclusion)"'`.
Workflows with continue-on-error jobs report run-level conclusion `success`
even when jobs fail — you MUST check job-level conclusions. If any jobs have
conclusion `failure`, treat it the same as a run-level failure.

**REPORTING RULE** — NEVER report `ci: all green` if ANY job has conclusion
`failure`, even if the run-level conclusion is `success`. The `ci:` line in
the status report MUST reflect the WORST job-level result across all
workflows. A continue-on-error job failure is NOT green — it is RED. Do not
qualify failures as "known", "pre-existing", or "cosmetic".

Only act on failures from the last 2 hours (compare `createdAt` with
`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`). For each failure:

1. `gh run view <ID> --log-failed 2>&1 | tail -80`.
2. Categorize: build error, test failure, timeout, flaky, infrastructure.
3. Check for an existing open issue:
   `gh issue list --search "<workflow name + signature>" --state open`.
   If one matches, `gh issue comment <N>` with the new evidence (sha, log
   snippet, timestamp) and ensure it has the `ready` label
   (`gh issue edit <N> --add-label ready`).
4. Otherwise, file a new issue: `gh issue create --label ready --title "<workflow>: <short signature>" --body "..."` with investigation findings.
5. Do NOT commit a fix. Report: `CI ISSUE FILED — <workflow> failed on <sha>, filed/commented #<N>`.

## Bug filing workflow

Applies to node bugs, metric alerts, and CI failures:

1. Identify the failing signature (ledger + error type for node bugs; metric
   + threshold for alerts; workflow + job + error type for CI).
2. Investigate to root cause — read source code, trace code paths.
3. Check for an existing open issue: `gh issue list --search "<keywords>" --state open`.
   If a match exists, verify its state is OPEN
   (`gh issue view <N> --json state -q .state`) and then `gh issue comment <N>`
   with the new evidence and ensure the `ready` label is set, and STOP.
4. If no OPEN match, file a new issue using `gh issue create --label ready`
   with a self-contained proposal body (symptom, evidence, suspected root cause,
   fix sketch with file:line references).
5. Do NOT spawn agents. Do NOT edit the main checkout. The next redeploy tick
   (check 10) will pick up whatever lands on main.

**Recurrence policy**: If a previously-filed bug recurs with material new
evidence, prefer commenting on the existing issue when it is the same bug at
the same site AND the issue is OPEN. If the prior issue is CLOSED, file a new
`ready`-labeled issue with `Related to #<prior> (closed)` in the body and a
note on why the prior fix did not cover this case; do NOT comment on the
closed issue. File a new issue (still referencing `Related to #<prior>` with
one-line scope-diff) when new evidence points at a different named subsystem,
phase/mark, root-cause hypothesis, or candidate site set.

**Commit policy**: the monitor does NOT commit code. All fixes are delegated
via `gh issue` with the `ready` label.

**Deploy regression policy**: If the node fails after a deploy, (a) file or
comment on a `ready`-labeled GitHub issue with the regression details
(commit range, symptoms, watchdog data); (b) restart the node on the last
known-good binary (rebuild from the previous commit) while waiting for the
fix. Do NOT revert commits inline.

## Investigation

For ANY anomaly, investigate to root cause — read source code, check logs,
trace code paths. Never dismiss as "expected". Produce a `ready`-labeled
GitHub issue (or comment on an existing one) for every anomaly that isn't
immediately explained. **Only exception**: anomalies whose root cause turns
out to be literal expected-correct behavior per the code — document the code
path in the status report and skip the filing.

## Output

Print a multiline status report:

```

```

Use WARNING for threshold breaches. Use ACTION when a corrective action was
taken (restart, deploy, filed a new issue, commented on an existing issue).
Use SYNC FAILURE (not WARNING) when the node has exceeded the active sync
deadline (15m populated / 4h fresh-start) but is not closing ledgers in
real-time — this is a bug that requires immediate investigation AND
filing/commenting on a `ready`-labeled issue.

## Self-reflection

After the status report is emitted, look back at THIS tick's output and
check for problems **in the monitor itself** — not in the node. The node
is covered by the `## Investigation` policy above. This section is about
bugs / miscalibrations in the tick logic, thresholds, catalog, or
detection code that fired false positives, failed silently, or rendered
contradictory output.

### What to look for

1. **False-positive alert**: a check fired, but investigation showed the
   underlying state is expected-correct. Root cause is the catalog
   threshold / rule, not the node. (Examples from this session:
   `scp_verifier_thread_state !=1` was inverted; `quorum_agree <4` fires
   between externalizations by design.)
2. **Silent failure**: a check returned empty / zero due to a tool bug.
   (Examples: zsh glob `NO_NOMATCH` killed a pipeline; a histogram
   metric name had a typo and silently resolved to `count_delta=0`
   which skipped evaluation.)
3. **Self-contradictory output**: `sync: synced` alongside
   `metrics: peer_count<8 WARN`, or similar internal inconsistency that
   suggests a missing warmup exemption or cross-check rule.
4. **Missing carveout**: a gauge / counter fires during a legitimate
   transient (startup, restart-warmup, crash-recovery replay) but has
   no exemption in the catalog.

If none of the above: report `self_reflect: clean` and stop.

### Three tiers of action

When an issue is found, choose a tier and act on it in the same tick.

**Tier 1 — Fix inline (trivial edit).**

Criteria (ALL must hold):
- Change is contained to `.claude/skills/monitor-tick/SKILL.md`
  (no other files touched)
- Diff < 50 lines
- No new runtime dependency (no new file path, env var, or metric name
  that the skill depends on)
- The edit is a clear text change with an obvious correct value:
  typo fix, threshold adjustment to match an observed live baseline,
  shell-portability fix, adding a metric to an existing exemption
  list, rendering-template tweak
- The need is demonstrated by THIS tick's observation — not speculative

Action sequence (same pattern used for every skill edit in this repo):

```bash
# 1. Edit .claude/skills/monitor-tick/SKILL.md
# 2. git add .claude/skills/monitor-tick/SKILL.md
# 3. git commit -m "Monitor-tick: <what + why>" with Co-authored-by: Claude Code trailer
# 4. git push origin main (on reject: git pull --rebase && git push)
```

Report: `self_reflect: fixed inline (<short-sha>: <short-desc>)`.

**Tier 2 — File `ready` GH issue (non-trivial but codeable).**

The issue is real and actionable but any of:
- Touches multiple files or crates
- Requires a design choice (which metric? which threshold value?
  which algorithm?)
- Needs verification beyond the tick (new test cases, reproducing
  with a build)
- Affects runtime contracts (env schema, file format, section
  ordering that another skill depends on)

Before filing, search for an existing open issue:
`gh issue list --search "monitor-tick: <keywords>" --state open`.
Comment with new evidence if a match exists; otherwise file.

Issue body MUST include:
- **Symptom**: one-line description of the false positive / silent
  failure / contradiction
- **Evidence**: exact tick output and command results that demonstrated
  the issue
- **Suspected root cause**: which rule / threshold / code path
- **Concrete fix sketch**: file:line references and proposed diff
  direction
- **Related to #<prior>** if it's a recurrence of something already
  filed

Label: `ready`. Title format:
- `Non-critical: monitor-tick: <description>` — for observability /
  calibration issues (noise reduction, threshold tuning)
- `monitor-tick: <description>` — for correctness bugs (silent
  failures, contradictory output)

Report: `self_reflect: filed #<N> (ready: <short-desc>)`.

**Tier 3 — File `not-ready` GH issue (human input required).**

Use this tier when any of:
- The fix has product/ops policy implications (e.g., "should we
  monitor a new metric class?", "should we change the restart
  philosophy?", "should we broaden the auto-deploy trigger?")
- Ambiguous scope — fix A, B, or C would all work and the right
  choice depends on operator intent
- Touches the node code, another skill, or config defaults — the
  downstream fixer should not auto-pick this up without explicit
  operator direction

Issue body includes everything from Tier 2 plus an explicit
**"Human input required"** section listing the specific
decisions / options that need an operator answer.

Label: `not-ready`. Title format:
`monitor-tick: [needs-decision] <description>`.

Report: `self_reflect: filed #<N> (not-ready: <short-desc>)`.

### Boundaries

- **Scope is single-tick.** Do not retrospectively review prior ticks
  for drift. Cross-tick pattern detection is a separate concern.
- **Never suppresses a real node-side filing.** If a check flagged a
  SYNC FAILURE on the node and self-reflection concludes the detection
  was over-eager, the SYNC FAILURE filing still goes out this tick
  (real-or-not is downstream's call). File a separate Tier 2 issue to
  tune the detection.
- **Never re-opens or argues with already-filed issues** from this
  or prior ticks. Those stand as-is.
- **Trivial-fix bias**: when in doubt between Tier 1 and Tier 2,
  prefer Tier 2 (filing) over an aggressive inline edit. Inline edits
  affect every subsequent tick immediately; better to write up the
  rationale and let the operator review.
