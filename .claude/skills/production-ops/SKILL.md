Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If `--fresh` is present, set `$FRESH = true`. Otherwise set `$FRESH = false`.

# Production Operations

Operate henyey as a production-grade Stellar mainnet client. This involves
two concurrent workloads (sweep historical ledgers and track the live
network), automated bug fixing, code maintenance, and disk housekeeping.

**Mainnet operation is explicitly authorized** — this overrides the
testnet-only guideline in CLAUDE.md.

## Startup

1. Read `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` to determine current progress. If
   `$FRESH = true`, ignore prior sweep state and plan to start from
   L59501312 (first protocol-24 checkpoint).
2. Generate a session ID (8-char random hex). All session data goes
   under `~/data/<session-id>/`.
3. Create directories:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/data/<session-id>/{logs,cache,cargo-target}
   ```
4. Build the binary:
   ```
   CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/data/<session-id>/cargo-target cargo build --release
   ```
5. Create git worktrees for concurrent operation (use `--detach` since
   `main` is already checked out):
   ```
   git worktree add --detach ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-tracker HEAD
   git worktree add --detach ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-1 HEAD
   git worktree add --detach ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-2 HEAD
   ```
6. Start the status monitor background loop (see Status Updates below).

## Tasks

Tasks are listed in priority order. When the tracker and sweeper both
surface bugs simultaneously, prioritize the tracker (it is live).

### Task 1: Tracker (highest priority)

Run a mainnet validator that tracks the live network. Operates in the
`worktree-tracker` worktree.

**Start the validator:**
```
~/data/<session-id>/cargo-target/release/henyey run --validator \
  -c configs/validator-mainnet.toml \
  2>&1 | tee ~/data/<session-id>/logs/tracker.log
```

**Monitor:** Continuously tail the tracker log for errors, hash
mismatches, panics, or crashes. When an issue is found:
1. Follow the Bug Fix Workflow below.
2. Rebuild the binary.
3. Restart the validator.

### Task 2: Sweepers (2 concurrent)

Verify historical mainnet ledger ranges using verify-execution. Up to 2
verify-execution processes run concurrently, each in its own worktree.

**Worktrees:** `worktree-sweeper-1` and `worktree-sweeper-2`. Create
both during startup:
```
git worktree add --detach ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-1 HEAD
git worktree add --detach ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-2 HEAD
```

**Resume point:** Read from `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md`. Assign each sweeper
a non-overlapping chunk starting from the first unverified ledger.

**Chunk size:** 100,000 ledgers per invocation.

**Cache directories:** Each sweeper MUST use its own cache directory to
avoid corruption from concurrent bucket downloads:
```
~/data/<session-id>/cache-1   # for sweeper-1
~/data/<session-id>/cache-2   # for sweeper-2
```

**Invocation (per sweeper):**
```
cd ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-N && \
~/data/<session-id>/cargo-target/release/henyey verify-execution \
  --mainnet --from <START> --to <END> \
  --stop-on-error --quiet \
  --cache-dir ~/data/<session-id>/cache-N \
  2>&1 | tee ~/data/<session-id>/logs/sweep-<START>-<END>.log
```

**On success:** Update `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` with the verified range.
Clean stale cache from the completed range (bucket files that won't be
reused by the next chunk):
```
# Remove checkpoint-specific cache entries for completed ranges
find ~/data/<session-id>/cache -name "*.xdr*" -mmin +30 -delete 2>/dev/null
```
Advance that sweeper to the next unverified chunk.

**On error:**
1. Mark the range from chunk start to (failed ledger - 1) as **CLEAN**
   in `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` — those ledgers were verified successfully
   and must not be scanned again.
2. Follow the Bug Fix Workflow below.
3. After the fix, rebuild the binary and resume from the **failed
   ledger** (not the chunk start). Use a new chunk that starts at the
   failed ledger and ends at the original chunk end.

**On unfixable bug (3 failed attempts):** Document the issue in
`docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` under a "Known Issues" section with: ledger
number, error type, investigation notes, and attempted fixes. Skip past
the problematic ledger and continue with the next chunk.

**Goal:** Keep sweeping forward until all available ledgers are verified.

### Task 3: Post-Commit Review

After every bug-fix commit from Task 1 or Task 2:
- Run `/review-fix --apply` on the commit.
- If the review surfaces issues, fix them before resuming the
  sweep/tracker.

### Task 4: Code Maintenance (daily)

Run at least once per day, or after completing a sweep range:
- `/simplify --apply` for all crates that had changes.
- `/document` for all crates that had changes.
- `/parity-check --apply` for all crates that had changes.

### Task 5: Disk Housekeeping (every 4 hours)

Run a cleanup pass every 4 hours:
- Check disk usage: `df -h ~/data/`
- Remove old cargo target dirs from dead sessions (sessions with no
  running processes).
- Remove log files older than 48 hours.
- Remove stale cache files from completed sweep ranges.
- If disk usage exceeds 85% after cleanup, alert in the status summary
  and aggressively prune older session data.

## Bug Fix Workflow

When a hash mismatch, error, or crash is encountered:

1. **Identify** the failing ledger number and error type from the log.
2. **Reproduce** with a targeted offline test:
   ```
   henyey verify-execution --from <LEDGER> --to <LEDGER> \
     --stop-on-error --show-diff
   ```
3. **Write a failing unit test** that isolates the bug. The test must
   fail before the fix.
4. **Fix the code** in the main worktree (not a task worktree).
5. **Verify** the unit test passes.
6. **Run `cargo test --all`** to check for regressions.
7. **Commit** the fix and regression test together:
   ```
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "<Imperative description of fix>"
   ```
8. **Push** immediately: `git push` (if rejected, `git pull --rebase && git push`).
9. **Run `/review-fix --apply`** on the commit.
10. **Rebuild** the binary:
    ```
    CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/data/<session-id>/cargo-target cargo build --release
    ```
11. **Pull the fix** into all worktrees:
    ```
    cd ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-tracker && git pull --rebase
    cd ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-1 && git pull --rebase
    cd ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-2 && git pull --rebase
    ```
12. **Update `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md`** with the bug details and fix.
13. **Commit and push** the updated SWEEP_STATUS.md:
    ```
    git add docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md
    git commit -m "SWEEP_STATUS.md: document <bug-id> fix"
    git push
    ```
14. **Resume** the sweep or restart the tracker.

## State & Persistence

All state is designed to survive session restarts. A new session reads
the persisted state and picks up where the previous session left off.

- **`docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md`**: Source of truth for sweep progress. Updated
  after each completed chunk, bug fix, or known issue. Contains:
  - Verified ranges (clean)
  - In-progress ranges
  - Bugs found and fixed (with commit hashes)
  - Known issues (unfixable bugs)
  - Current sweep frontier
- **Logs**: `~/data/<session-id>/logs/` — sweep, tracker, and review logs.
- **Binary**: `~/data/<session-id>/cargo-target/release/henyey`

On session restart:
1. Read `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` for sweep state.
2. Check for running processes from previous sessions.
3. Clean up orphaned worktrees: `git worktree prune`.
4. Create fresh worktrees and resume.

## Status Updates

Run a background loop that prints a status summary every 10 minutes:

```
while true; do
  sleep 600
  # Gather and print status
done
```

Each summary includes:

```
═══ PRODUCTION OPS STATUS — <timestamp> ═══
Session: <session-id>

SWEEP
  Frontier:    L<current>
  Verified:    L59501312 – L<latest clean>  (<N> ledgers, <percent>%)

═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Concurrency Model

- **Tracker** and **Sweepers** run in separate git worktrees so they can
  operate independently without interfering with each other's working
  directory state.
- Up to **2 sweeper processes** run concurrently on non-overlapping
  ledger ranges. Each sweeper uses its own worktree.
- Bug fixes are committed on `main` in the primary repo, then pulled
  into all worktrees via `git pull --rebase`.
- The status monitor runs as a background loop independent of all tasks.

## Teardown

When stopping (user interrupts or all ledgers verified):
1. Stop the tracker validator gracefully.
2. Stop any running verify-execution process.
3. Remove worktrees:
   ```
   git worktree remove ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-tracker
   git worktree remove ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-1
   git worktree remove ~/data/<session-id>/worktree-sweeper-2
   ```
4. Print a final status summary.
5. Do NOT remove logs or cache — they may be useful for debugging.

## Guidelines

- Always build with `--release` — debug builds are too slow for mainnet.
- Keep `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md` up to date — it is the contract between
  sessions.
- **Never re-scan clean ranges.** Do not run verify-execution on ranges
  already marked clean in SWEEP_STATUS.md unless `$FRESH = true`. When
  resuming after a bug fix, start from the exact failed ledger, not
  from the beginning of the chunk.
- When fixing bugs, follow the test-first workflow strictly. Do not skip
  writing a failing test.
- Commit bug fixes immediately after the test passes. Do not batch fixes.
- **Push after every fix commit** — do not accumulate unpushed commits.
- **Commit and push `docs/SWEEP_STATUS.md`** immediately after documenting
  a new bug or fix.
- **Daily commit**: Commit and push the sweep status report at least once
  per day, even if no bugs were found. Use message format:
  `SWEEP_STATUS.md: daily update — <summary>`.
- If a push is rejected, pull with rebase and retry.
- All commits must include the appropriate `Co-authored-by` trailer per
  CLAUDE.md.
